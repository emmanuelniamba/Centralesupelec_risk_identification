"section": "I. INTRODUCTION",
"content": "Background\nJust about every major industry has made large strides towards computerization. More and more Americans rely on computer networks to do things like shop, request services, and even earn degrees. Technology has transformed and improved our lives in so many ways, yet our healthcare system seems to be lagging behind this trend. In order to keep up with a technology driven society, we need to incorporate computerization into our medical practices. New Century Wellness Group is a cutting edge medical provider offering a holistic approach to healthcare focusing on preventative and traditional medical care. The clinic has a patient base of 8,000 patients coming from 325 different employers who, for the most part, provide healthcare benefits to their employees. New Century is currently accepting health insurance plans from 25 different insurance carriers. Because of their success, New Century is now considering opening a new location. Being that the medical field thrives on information and communication, it is time New Century makes technology work for them too. With an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system in place New Century could better serve patients’ spending less time trying to keep an out-of-date filing and billing system in order, and focusing more on their health and wellbeing.",

This workflow  has  worked up until  now,  but with  the  changes  to the  healthcare  system,  ever-growing number  of patients  and influx  of  patient  data, these  people  of overworked  and stressed  out.   The growing  amount  of  work causes employees  to have  to devote  six  hours  of overtime  each week just  to keep up.  This  system  results  in  about  three  file  errors each  day, and each error takes twenty  minutes  to correct.  At this  rate, the  clinic  will  need  to hire  another  clerical  person.         Continuing  to run  the office  this  way  is inefficient  and not  cost effective,  and makes  New Century  vulnerable  to human errors and can negatively impact our patients’ care and experience.",

"content": "REQUIREMENTS MODELING\n        The  system  New Century  Wellness  Group  is currently  using  is  not only  outdated  but also\nnot working  for the  staff.   It is  a mixture  of paper-based and legacy  systems  that  depends  entirely\ntoo much  on the  staff  for  accuracy  and completion.   New Century  staff  includes  four  primary\ncare physicians,  one nurse  practitioner,  four  physical  therapists,  one registered  nutritionist,  eight\nnurses  and eight  staff  members  caring  for  a patient  base of 8,000 from  325 different  employers\nwho cover employees’ health and maintenance.          New Century currently accepts 25 different\nhealth  insurance  providers.   On top of all  this,  they  are planning  to open another  branch.   Each\nstaff  member  is  responsible  for  different  aspects of  how the  business  is  run  and there  is  too much\nroom  for error.   At this  rate the current  staff  will  have  to start  putting  in  overtime  and they  will\nneed to hire  at least  one  more staff  member.\n        Currently,  Anita  Davenport,  the  office  manager,  supervises  the  seven-member  staff.   Fred\nBrown  is in  charge  of  human  resources  and oversees  employee  benefits.   Corinne  Summers\nreports directly  to him  and is responsible  for  payroll,  tax  reporting  and profit  distribution  among\nthe  associates.   Susan  Gifford  maintains  the  patient  medical  records.  Tom  Capaletti  oversees\naccounts  receivables.   Tammy  Alipio  is a billing  specialist  and takes care of insurance  billing.\nLisa  Sung,  the  receptionist,  manages  appointments,  contacts  patients  to remind  them  of\nupcoming appointments and prepares each provider’s daily appointment list.",

"section": "Project Overview",
"content": "Carla Herrera orders replacement medical supplies after patient visits (Rosenblatt, Systems Analysis and Design, Tenth Edition, 2014). The staff is overworked and they will soon need to hire more staff if something is not done to change this.\nTo improve this situation, Dr. Jones has asked that we create an in-house system so that the providers and the staff can work more efficiently. We are going to implement a business solution system and an EMR system that will work together. They want a medical practice software solution that allows office staff to streamline scheduling, billing, accounting, and payroll as well as support an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system, and Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). A prebuilt EMR software system was presented and considered, but Dr. Jones prefers that we build the system in-house so that they can customize it and possibly upgrade to an EHR system in the future. The integrated system we are building will work as follows:\nWhen a patient calls in, Lisa Sung will schedule an appointment with an appropriate provider dependent upon services requested. When they come to their scheduled appointment, their provider is notified and an EMR is initiated which will include their patient demographics, medical history, and insurance information. This also creates a daily list of appointments. Whichever provider the patient sees will then enter any medical orders and/or prescriptions into the EMR with the CPOE system. Their input is supported by the CDSS to ensure proper care is administered. Patients then schedule a follow up appointment with Lisa. Susan Gifford reviews the EMR to make sure records are complete and entered correctly. Carla Herrera orders supplies to replace items used for patient visits. Tammy Alipio will then bill their insurance provider based on services rendered. Tom Capaletti follows up on billing to ensure claims are paid.",

"content": "At the moment New Century Wellness Group requires six hours of office staff overtime and they will have to hire another clerical person within six month just to keep up with all of the work. New Century needs a computer system in place to eliminate the need for overtime work and a new hire. It will also significantly cut down on the number of errors made to each file. Currently, New Century sees an average of three errors per day and each errors takes about twenty minutes to correct. My investigation into what type of system would be best for New Century began with several face-to-face meetings with Dr. Jones and Anita Davenport. Together we reviewed office records and accounting records. As far as business solutions go, I was able to deduce that the four key areas that most needed improvement were patient scheduling, billing and accounts receivable, human resources and payroll. These areas are highly interactive and therefore an integrated system would be best (Rosenblatt, Systems Design and Analysis, 10th Edition, 2014). Dr. Jones also expressed interest in an EMR system, but after research and careful consideration we decided a separate system for this would work best. I wanted to make sure every member of staff who will use this system has a sense of ownership so in my further investigations I was sure to take everyone’s needs and wants into consideration when coming up with this plan. I conducted staff interviews, reviewed office reports, and observed office workflow and believe I have come up with the best solution for New Century’s currently patient load, and future growth. The medical services and procedures currently performed by New Century’s medical staff are coded in accordance with the American Medical Association’s Current Procedure Terminology (CPT). A CPT code is made up of five numeric digits and a two-digit suffix. These codes are required by most insurance companies to ensure proper paying and billing.",

With this new system in place, New Century will be able to cut costs and patients will be able to go online to update their medical information, schedule appointments, and request medical records (Rosenblatt, Systems Analysis and Design, 10th Edition, 2014).

When the patient comes to their scheduled appointment they fill out a patient intake form asking for further personal information, medical history, and insurance information. This information is entered into their EMR and the provider enters current medical information pertaining to the visit. The provider can then use the CPOE system to enter medical orders for the patient. The CDSS then uses the information in the EMR to ensure proper care is given.",

The  PERT\nchart  will  map out  exactly  what  needs  to be done to ensure  the new  system  is  implemented\nproperly  (Rosenblatt,  Systems  Design  and Analysis,  10th Edition,  2014).  Keeping  this  chart  will\nalso allow me to keep New Century’s partners and staff apprised of our progress.

Through  regular\nproject status  meetings  with  Bill  and Celia,  I will  be able  to collect,  verify,  organize  and evaluate\ninformation  about the  project.  I will  be able to relay  any  necessary  information  to Dr. Jones and\nthe  New Century  staff.   These  meetings  will  also  allow  my  team  and I to brainstorm  solutions  to\nany  problems  that  arise.   Should  the  New Century  staff  prefer  documented  progress,  these\nmeetings  will  allow  me  to create reports  detailing  exactly  where  we are in  the implementation\nprocess and answer  any  questions  they  may  have.   I also  plan  on meeting  with  Dr. Jones\nthroughout  implementation  to answer  any  questions  he and partners  may  have.
