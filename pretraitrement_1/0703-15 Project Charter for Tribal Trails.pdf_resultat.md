"content": "Per Chapter 5 of the Integrated Transportation Plan, major capital projects specifically identified in the ITP are to be guided by a Project Charter. The Project Charter is to be initiated by the appropriate elected body. As the Board of County Commissioners have jurisdiction over the lands within the Tribal Trails Road project boundary, the BCC shall vote to initiate this project.\nAmong other elements, the Project Charter shall identify or describe the following: purpose and need for the project; project objectives; project location, project extents, and project elements; environmental review required; roles and responsibilities of the project development team, elected officials, and Stakeholder Committee; required resources including project cost, staff resources, professional services, and funding; and risk assessment.\nOn March 20, 2018, the County Commissioners voted to enter into a Cooperative Agreement with Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). Under the agreement, WYDOT will manage the design, approval and construction process for the Tribal Trails Road project. WYDOT will conduct all preliminary survey work, engineering investigations, environmental and right-of-way studies and will develop conceptual and final design plans and specifications. Teton County will be responsible for public outreach throughout the project. WYDOT will assist with public meetings and conduct any NEPA-required processes. Approval of the Tribal Trails Road project charter will mark the formal start of work by Teton County and WYDOT on the project.",

"section": "Purpose and Need",
"content": "Purpose - To provide travel redundancy and improved multi-modal connectivity between South Park neighborhoods and areas accessed by Highway 22, including Wilson, Teton Village, other West Bank neighborhoods, and eastern Idaho. Currently, motor vehicles making these connections must travel through the Y intersection (US Highways 26/89 and Wyoming Highway 22), adding to the congestion at this major crossroad. This poor connectivity limits options for better transit services as well as fire ambulance service to affected neighborhoods in West Jackson and parts of Teton County that include Boyles Hill, Cottonwood Park, Indian Trails, 3 Creeks, and Teton County School District #1 campuses.\nNeed – This project is needed to reduce vehicle miles of travel (VMT) associated with circuitous routing of traffic, to reduce local trips through the Y intersection, to improve emergency response, and to provide improved transit options.",

{
"section": "Project Objectives",
"content": "Safety - To improve emergency vehicle access and provide route redundancy in and around West Jackson and South Park.\nEnvironmental Protection – To provide better connectivity and capacity in order to reduce vehicle miles travelled and vehicle emissions.\nCost Effectiveness – To reduce vehicle miles travelled and thus reduce travel costs for the community.\nRoadway Network Compatibility – To provide network redundancy to reduce local trips through the Y intersection. To minimize delays caused by maintenance operations and crashes on US-26/89 and WY-22. These events can isolate the Town from Teton Village, Wilson, and other West Bank areas.\nMultimodal Function – To provide more direct routing for START transit services and Teton County School District buses between South Park and the West Bank.",
