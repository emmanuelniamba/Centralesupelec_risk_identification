As COVID-19 spread throughout the world in the spring of 2020, AstraZeneca recognized the need for an effective COVID-19 vaccine to defeat the virus. In April 2020 AstraZeneca joined forces with the University of Oxford to make a meaningful difference and save lives. This landmark partnership brought together world-class expertise in vaccinology with AstraZeneca’s ability to deliver a global solution at scale.",

"section": "PROJECT MANAGEMENT",
"content": "Building from the Ground Up\nAs AstraZeneca’s Global Project and Portfolio Management\nfunction prepared to undertake the project, it quickly identified\nthree gaps:\n1)  internal project managers experienced in vaccine\n    development,\n2)  project management processes fit for moving at the speed\n    the vaccine project required, and\n3)  an internal government contracting organization that could\n    support the project.\nBefore addressing these gaps, though, it needed the project\nmanagement infrastructure necessary to address the unique\nchallenges of this project.\nEstablishing a PMO\nThe first step was to create a project management office\n(PMO). Prior to COVID, the AstraZeneca R&D unit did not have\na PMO because the types of projects it managed didn’t require\nthe capabilities of a dedicated office. The vaccine project was a\ndifferent story.\nPMI’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of\nKnowledge (PMBOK® Guide) provided the framework for\nthe creation of the PMO. \"We literally pulled out the PMBOK\nand said, ‘What kind of PMO are we going to deploy next week?\nWhat are the control elements that a typical PMO would have,\nand which ones do we most need on this one?’” Dixon said. “We\ncouldn’t build a PMO that would take two years because we had\nto do it in a week.”\n       \"We literally pulled out the PMBOK\n      and said, ‘What kind of PMO are we\n      going to deploy next week?’”\n                                   - Colleen Dixon",

"section": "PMO Key Roles",
"content": "Given the time pressure, Dixon’s team prioritized four key roles for the PMO:\n1) Integration of schedule and budget. This included adapting the enterprise system to support billing for a US government contract and setting up cost codes for time entry.\n2) Contract management. This provided a centralized resource for team members and functional owners who needed to understand the relevant terms and conditions of contracts with different governments and entities.\n3) Team process guidance. The PMO developed guidance and training for team members on ways of working on various government contracts, including considerations ranging from time entry to client confidentiality.\n4) Risk management. This enabled the team to understand and manage key risks to the project and the business.\nThe ability to rely on the PMBOK® Guide framework relieved the project management team of having to design the PMO from scratch. It also served as a source of credibility that Dixon could lean on in conversations with senior leaders: “’We have a control framework, and it’s based on the PMBOK, and this is how other companies do it. It’s the right way to do it.’”",

"section": "Staffing the Project",
"content": "The next challenge was to staff the PMO. Hiring externally would have taken time that the project didn’t have, so Dixon started her search internally, looking for people within her existing team of 80 project managers, as well as people outside the team with relevant experience in their careers. Drawing on her knowledge of their backgrounds and on feedback from others across the company, Dixon staffed the vaccine team with people who had worked on government contracts or vaccine projects in the past. One person, for example, had worked for a company that helped other drug manufacturers secure government contracts, and another had worked on government contracts for a company AstraZeneca had acquired.",

"section": "Focusing the Project Manager’s Role",
"content": "Dixon hired Tina Guina, who previously had worked at the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), to serve as the lead R&D global project manager for the vaccine project.\nThe project manager, however, would have to play a different role than in a typical AstraZeneca R&D project. On those projects, the project manager would often serve as a relationship manager with the external partner or customer, negotiating the contract with support from the project staff while also managing the project. But the vaccine project was too big, complex, and risky for the project manager to have such a broad role. The US government contract alone was so big that the responsibilities had to be divided. The newly created PMO proved invaluable for easing the project manager’s responsibilities in contract management, schedule and budget integration, compliance, and risk management, enabling her to focus primarily on the efforts of the project team.",

"section": "Scaling to Meet Government Requirements",
"content": "Working with government contracts of this size and scope called for project management deliverables that were not standard practice for AstraZeneca R&D projects. A typical drug project schedule might track a few hundred topline tasks, with responsibility delegated to sub-teams to manage at greater levels of detail. Contracts of this size and scope required a master schedule, which in turn demanded bringing in a person with this experience to kickstart the process. The budgeting process was similarly unfamiliar: most R&D project budgets were developed at a high level from the top down. Government contracts often require a bottom-up approach with significantly more detail.",

"section": "LESSON LEARNED",
"content": "Adapt, Adapt, Adapt\nAdaptability was the core project management challenge. At every step, the project faced changing circumstances as governments across the globe lined up to become customers. For example, the US government initially planned to issue the contract through BARDA, but given the sheer size of the agreement, elected to move the contract to the Department of Defense (DOD), which had significantly more experience with procurements of this size.",

"section": "Project Management Insights",
"content": "“We had to totally rework a different contract with a different group of people,” Dixon said. “It was ultimately a good switch because of the DOD’s capabilities, but it was hard to be in the middle of the negotiation and have to start over.”\nAs the project acquired increasing numbers of government customers, it also had to secure agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) in various geographies to ensure that it would have the necessary production capability.\nThere was no time for hesitation since other vaccine projects would be seeking manufacturing capacity as well. “We were grabbing CMOs as best we could,” said Guina. “Under this immense pressure, the speed was incredible.”\nWhile the team worked 24/7, its commitment to the mission, which was shared throughout the company, served as an essential motivator.\nBut knowing when to adapt was important too. “There’s also a fine line between how much adaptability there should be, how much adaptability is actually feasible, and deciding when it’s ok to let go,” said Guina. \"It’s the goal for the project manager to know when to push, when to pull, when to work offline with somebody, and when to try to pull a team together to discuss things. To manage things appropriately without a breakdown is a question mark every day.”\n       “There’s also a fine line between how\n       much adaptability there should be, how\n       much adaptability is actually feasible, and\n       deciding when it’s ok to let go.
