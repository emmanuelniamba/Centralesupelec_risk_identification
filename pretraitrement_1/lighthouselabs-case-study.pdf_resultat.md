By June, it could process     5,000 tests per day with a 24-hour turnaround     time through a brute-force effort that was not    sustainable over time. Moreover, it sought to     achieve a sixteen-fold increase in capacity       over 3-4 months. Scaling an ongoing program       of this size would typically take years.",

Jerome Finlayson of the Scottish Manufacturing    Advisory Service reached out to the Scottish\ngovernment to discuss ways of achieving the\nscale required to address the needs of this\ncrisis.\nA series of meetings led to the identification of a\nresearch laboratory at Queen Elizabeth\nUniversity Hospital in Glasgow as a site that\ncould be repurposed as COVID testing facility.\nThe new facility, dubbed the Lighthouse\nLaboratory, was founded as a partnership\namong Glasgow University, the National Health\nService (NHS), The Department of Health and\nSocial Care and Bio Clavis, a private industry\nfirm.",

"content": "Hybrid—Whatever Works\nWith a compelling mission of the utmost importance,\nLighthouse Labs attracted 750 passionate volunteers\nwilling to fill 220 roles. The pandemic provided a sense of\npurpose that was a critical motivator for a team facing long\nhours and a massive learning challenge.\nFIND A STARTING POINT\nThe lab’s leadership team began by developing a\ncomprehensive 12-week project plan, but quickly realized\nthat the dynamic environment of the pandemic required a\nmore agile approach.\nInstead, it turned to the techniques of Kaizen and Focused\nImprovement Teams in order to work toward very clear\nobjectives over daily and weekly timeframes.\nLEAN PRINCIPLES\nThe team made extensive use of lean principles to\nimplement process improvements that would allow it to\nwork most efficiently and effectively while maintaining the\nhighest quality standards.\nPlan > Do > Check > Act\nAs soon as the team agreed on a more agile approach, it\nimplemented tightly coupled Plan > Do > Check > Act\ncycles that enabled it to iterate continuously in response to\nchanging circumstances.\nBottleneck Management / Theory of Constraints\nThe team identified bottlenecks in its processes that set\nthe pace for how long it would take to complete tasks with\ndependencies. Not all bottlenecks were viewed as\nproblems to be solved. For instance, the time necessary to\nopen a box containing a test sample could not be\neliminated—it would always be a factor in the overall\nspeed of delivering a test result. Even so, the process of\nopening boxes could be managed so that all workers on all\nshifts opened them using the same process in a uniform\namount of time.",

"content": "The development of standard work was essential for the lab to achieve scale. During the lab’s first weeks of operation, employees did not have work standards that were understood, reliable, predictable, and sustainable. Over time, the lab implemented standard work and identical modular workstations, and it provided clear instructions and structured training for workers.",
