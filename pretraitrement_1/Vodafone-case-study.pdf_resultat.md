"content": "ON-TIME PROJECT DELIVERY WITH COST SAVINGS\nThe first batch of customer site migrations to the new GLAN was delivered with a 90% success rate, and 100% of the sites migrated at the second attempt.\nThe Vodafone GLAN project was successfully delivered on time and ahead of the team’s target completion dates.\nThrough the use of proven project management waterfall methodology standardized by PMI:\n•  The customer gave Vodafone a 10/10 Net Promoter Score (NPS).\n•  Vodafone was able to deliver the project on time.\n•  Vodafone had cost savings in the resources budget.\n•  The project team captured the lessons learned to be used as a best practice for other future GLAN projects.\n•  Lessons learned sessions were conducted with the product team to share with them the best practice used for the GLAN product and what is its needs.\n“Our project team worked with the customer to understand how the solution would benefit their business. Then using the PMI standards, they implemented the solution on time with high quality.”\n - Adam Hyde, Head of Customer Design & Delivery",
