"section": "Background",
"content": "BAA Airports Ltd. was tasked with the refurbishment of Terminal 1, a 40-year-old building within Heathrow Airport, the busiest international airport in the world, whilst constantly keeping the terminal open to the 20 million annual travellers.\nIn 2004 BAA and the Star Alliance network, established in 1997 as the ﬁrst truly global airline alliance to offer worldwide reach and seamless service to the international traveller, signed a memorandum of understanding that would result in Star Alliance moving into Terminal 1 at Heathrow Airport.\nTerminal 1 had previously been for short-haul European destinations only, but the introduction of Star Alliance meant that international passengers would now also be using the terminal.\nThis work was required to facilitate the move by a number of Star Alliance airlines who were moving their operations from Terminals 2 and 3 to Terminal 1. The successful completion of this project was the enabler for the complete transformation of Heathrow Airport that is used by more than 90 airlines, which ﬂy to more than 180 destinations worldwide.\nAs well as a commitment to completing the project within a very strict deadline, health and safety issues were also a big concern given that the project had to be delivered within a live operating passenger terminal. Any interruption to the operation of the terminal building, and the stakeholders or passenger experience would likely result in delays for the airlines operating from Terminal 1 and as such, signiﬁcant financial penalties for BAA. Public and media perception of BAA would not be enhanced should such a situation arise.\nDavid Buisson, PMP, was chosen to lead the project. Mr. Buisson is a certiﬁed project manager with more than 13 years experience of managing complex and challenging projects by implementing the standards set out by the Project Management Institute (PMI®) through A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)—Fourth Edition.\nUnder his direction, a team of professionals from a variety of backgrounds and industries tackled one of the most important transport projects in the UK, keeping it ahead of its European competition.",

"content": "A Project Manager’s Landscape\nThe project team had to resolve a large number of challenging and unexpected problems during the refurbishment, including asbestos in the ceiling and inconsistencies to the floor level.\nIt was also a complex and challenging project for the team because the work was delivered in 42 different phases, whilst remaining operational at all times. There was also a tight time schedule to deliver the project, which was marred by additional scope being added constantly and several delays from airline partners with regards to their move date.\nIn these circumstances, the project manager consistently referred to A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fourth Edition for guidance on how to manage difficulties.\nDavid Buisson, PMP, Project Manager",

"content": "The People\nManagement of different people and teams on this project was quite challenging because of its scale and size. There were 11 top-tier suppliers who reported directly to the project manager, and dozens more who subsequently reported in to them, overall involving a very large number of workers.\nCommunications and time management would prove to be a challenge on a project involving this many different parties, especially because the project manager was keen to maintain a collaborative approach to problem solving.\nThe Planning\nThe large number of third parties working on this project potentially could have had severe repercussions on scheduling. If one contractor was late in finishing levelling the floor, this could delay the contractor that was scheduled to install the furniture, causing a larger knock-on effect throughout the project.",

"content": "Budget Changes\nBudgetary reviews on the project meant that some major late changes were made on the project including some to the original plan with only four weeks to go. The original design for the installation of a “cladding” system above the ticket desks for BMI Airlines that would improve both the aesthetics and lighting for the area was deleted from the scope of works just four weeks before the check-in desks were scheduled to open.",

"section": "Scope Management",
"content": "Structural Challenges\nA big challenge for the team was repairing damaged ﬂoor work in the terminal that was left when the building was initially constructed 40 years earlier.  Repairing the ﬂoor potentially added an extra 21 weeks of work to the project.  The ﬂoor in the East Linear face of the terminal was discovered to have been constructed from different materials to the rest of the ﬂooring in the terminal.  The ﬂoor was an uneven concrete surface instead of the regular terrazzo tiling, which to correct, would have added a signiﬁcant amount of time to the refurbishment.\nTechnological Challenges\nInformation Technology (IT) proved another challenge in the delivery of this project because the team had to replace existing systems within the terminal building.  This was a big challenge because it not only included standard ofﬁce network systems, but also specialist ﬂight systems such as Flight Information Display Screens, regulatory systems for passenger processing, and closed-circuit television.\nEnvironmental Challenges\nCompleting this project sustainably and installing sustainable and energy saving measures were an important component in the refurbishment project.  Given this was a renovation project and not the construction of a completely new building, installing truly sustainable features to save water for example, was very difﬁcult in an old fashioned building.",

A collaborative, non-hierarchical approach to human resources management was taken to ensure that maximum value was achieved and maximum knowledge extracted from the range of skills and professions contributing to the project.\nAs a commitment to the Project’s Human Resource Management knowledge area within the PMBOK® Guide, it was agreed very early on in the planning stage of the project that to have an effective and coordinated delivery team that could respond instantly to the demands of this project, the main contractor should be located in the same ofﬁce as the project team.  The project team felt that with unexpected changes to the scope of work such as the ﬂoor, the team would be able to deliver most effectively by being located in the same place.\nAdditionally, weekly and monthly meetings were held with all suppliers to address any grievances, problems, or issues.  When a problem did arise, the project manager would personally ensure that the issue was resolved quickly before moving on.  Good communications and people management ensured that the project progressed smoothly.",

"content": "£6.3million worth of additional work was added without an increase to the original project budget.\nBudgetary commitments meant that a number of last-minute changes were made to the project.  The project team and main contractor held a brainstorming session where one of the suggestions was to use hoarding panelling that had been used over the past 12 months for various other construction works.  Approval for this proposal was endorsed by the relevant stakeholders and the cladding was duly installed prior to the required deadline.\nThe cost estimating and budgeting efforts during the early stages of the project were very challenging and, in particular, getting the balance right in terms of work that would be undertaken at night versus those in the daytime hours.  This had a signiﬁcant impact on the project budget as work undertaken at night is far more costly and productivity is lower.",

"section": "Technological Challenges",
"content": "The use of this software played a vital role in communications management for the project, allowing the entire project team to have visibility of all activity on the project almost in real time, minimising time wasting or duplication of work. IT was an integral part of the Terminal 1 project because it allowed the project to be constantly monitored for problems by all parties involved. The IT team at BAA developed custom software for the project that incorporated an “Online Change Control” system that allowed any members of the team based on- or offsite to capture changes and send them online to the senior project manager for instant approval or rejection. Given the large number of contractors working on- and offsite, the system proved crucial to the delivery of the project. If groups working offsite identified a problem for example with the budget, they could raise an issue through the specially designed software that would go directly to the project manager who could instantaneously approve/reject any requests. This saved invaluable time on the project and meant that work could continue with less delay than would have been previously experienced.",

Despite the challenges of updating a building from the 60s, the project team strove to incorporate sustainable changes to the lighting and heating. Changes were made where possible including using energy saving bulbs throughout, and low-energy heating. Weekly coordination meetings were held to ensure that any problems or issues were picked up immediately and dealt with. Each meeting would examine a five week look ahead at the work schedule anticipating any future issues before they might happen. Project manager David Buisson would examine the top five risks every week with various contractors, visiting them onsite to determine a solution to the problem.",
