"section": "Background",
"content": "Since their inception in 1967, the Games have had a proud legacy of volunteer recruitment. Organizers in many of the previous host communities have successfully recruited thousands of willing volunteers to lend their time and expertise to help plan and share the host role. In 2003, in keeping with the volunteer tradition, organizers approached the Regina/South Saskatchewan PMI Chapter and asked for help. The chapter reached out to its membership to gauge interest in volunteering as a project manager for the games and received an overwhelming response.",

"section": "Challenges",
"content": "A central challenge for the games’ organizers and their project managers was that traditional project management could not be applied due to the volunteer nature of the games. A new model allowing for varying levels of formal project management practices among the volunteers would have to be created.",
