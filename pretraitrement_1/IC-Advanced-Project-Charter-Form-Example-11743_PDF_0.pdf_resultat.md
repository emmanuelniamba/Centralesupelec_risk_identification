"content": "PROBLEM          Our goal for this project is to install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to\nOR ISSUE         accommodate malls' and service stations' EV-charging needs.\nPURPOSE OF       The implementation of the 1,125 EV charging stations will reduce fossil-fuel emissions and have a positive impact on\PROJECT          the environment. This will help fulfill Positive Charge's mission of being the world's largest EV-charging provider and\n                  reduce the environmental impact of fossil-fuel cars through our services.\n                  As EVs become more prevalent, more EV-charging stations are needed to accommodate EV drivers' charging\nBUSINESS         needs. The implementation of the 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to\nCASE             accommodate malls' and service stations' EV-charging \"traffic\" will reduce the lengths to which EV drivers would\n                  have to travel for their next charge. The implementation of the EV-charging stations will also result in a 24% profit for\n                  Positive Charge.\nGOALS /          The project goal is to install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico and Canada. The\nMETRICS          metrics used to measure success will primarily be the following key performance indicators (KPIs): Revenue Growth,\n                  Client Retention Rate, and Customer Satisfaction.\nEXPECTED         Install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to accommodate malls' and\nDELIVERABLES     service stations' EV-charging needs.",
