How do you build a six-lane bridge at the busiest commercial border crossing between the United States and Canada that includes ports of entry for each nation, dedicated use paths for pedestrians and cyclists, connections to major highways on each side of the border, and toll collection facilities to finance its operation and maintenance?\nCONTEXT: Large and International\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is one of the largest infrastructure projects in North America. Once completed, it will stretch 1.5 miles (2.5 km), making it one of the five longest bridges in North America. The project also includes new ports of entry and inspection facilities for the Canadian and US governments, toll collection facilities, and improvements and modifications to several local bridges and roadways along the Michigan interchange with interstate highway I-75.",

"section": "APPROACH",
"content": "Project Management Body of Knowledge\nThe team that drafted the Request for Proposal (RFP) reviewed a range of previous major infrastructure projects as part of its due diligence process, and this review, together with its experience, revealed the need for sound project management practices on projects of this size and scope. The RFP team also knew that project management practices were important to multiple government stakeholders on each side of the border.\nAs a result, the project agreement between Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority and BNA calls for the project company to manage the project in accordance with A Guide to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide). This requirement —which was also in the project agreement for the Samuel De Champlain Bridge in Quebec—will ensure that the project is managed based on the best existing knowledge of the profession.\nThe commitment to sound project management extends beyond bridge construction to encompass all project requirements. For instance, Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority has an in-house team dedicated to managing and overseeing a $20 million (CAD) Community Benefits Plan that addresses both sides of the border. This team employs effective project management principles to ensure that the Plan delivers on its commitments.",

To date, the project has acquired the final properties needed for construction, selected the pedestrian bridge designs for the Michigan interchange with interstate highway I-75, and started work on the bridge tower foundations in Canada and the US.\nIn 2020, Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority received the top accolade for environmental, social, and governance performance at the P3 Awards, which recognize the best in public-private partnerships throughout the Americas. The award acknowledged the organization’s policies and benefits for stakeholders, operators, users, and the wider community.\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge project includes a comprehensive environmental program addressing more than 450 conditions identified in the bi-national environmental assessment process.",
