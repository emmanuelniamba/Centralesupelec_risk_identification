"content": "Together with engineering consultancy BECA, PMI helps NTZA improve travel speed and throughput by up to 15% As the keeper of New Zealand’s transportation infrastructure, the New Zealand Transport Agency’s (NZTA) mission is two-fold: to help New Zealanders travel reliably and safely and to grow the country’s economy by investing in moving people and freight. To accomplish these goals, the agency plans and delivers national transport networks; supports local networks; works to make public transport and freight networks more effective; and initiates and invests in projects that improve road safety. Prior to 2009, the NZTA faced a specific challenge: reducing the traffic congestion that was causing high numbers of rear-end crashes and morning/evening crashes on Auckland’s motorways. Having exhausted all feasible physical solutions, the agency turned instead towards risk mitigation through traffic management. The NCTA initiated the project with the objectives of improving traffic flow and safety on the motorways; enabling more consistent speeds for merging; and providing more predictable travel times. In addition, because the project had to be implemented across a large number of sites on Auckland’s motorways, elements of the project had to be incorporated into other NZTA capital projects. This meant the project team had to factor in a number of changes to the scope of work – a daunting task for large infrastructure projects involving specialised disciplines of construction and engineering.",

"content": "Both organizations were actively engaged with the NCTA from the early phases of the project’s design and implementation, including the task of securing support and buy-in. “One of the biggest challenges we faced was the number of approvals needed from a wide variety of stakeholders,” says David Bentham, a Project Manager for BECA and a PMI Project Management Professional (PMP)®. “For example, we had to get local council approval before construction started and we had to have the designs reviewed by independent experts employed by the NZTA.” According to Leon Wee, Senior Project Manager, Intelligent Transport Systems, NZTA, the main element of the project was implementing traffic signals on the ramps feeding into the motorways which manage the rate at which vehicles enter the main motorway. These signals operate only when they are needed – during shoulder peak times (just before and after the rush hours) – and can be switched off at all other times.",
