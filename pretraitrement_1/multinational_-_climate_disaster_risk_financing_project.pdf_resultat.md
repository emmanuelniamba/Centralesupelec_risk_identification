"section": "STRATEGIC CONTEXT",
"content": "A. Country Context, Strategy, and Objectives\n1. Djibouti, Somalia, and South Sudan are located in the Horn of Africa (HOA), a large extension of land that protrudes from the eastern edge of the continent of Africa, lying between the Indian Ocean to the east and the Gulf of Aden to the north. Although the “Horn of Africa” was previously used to define a political region that consists of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, the Greater HOA consists of more than the typical four countries, and includes Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. These countries are socially, economically, and ecologically diverse and, at the same time, are related geographically, historically, and demographically. They are also all members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), with ambitions to embark on regional integration. The region has a population of over 230 million people. The archipelago of Comoros consists of three volcanic islands (Grande Comore (also known as Ngazidja), Anjouan (also known as Ndzuwani), and Moheli (also known as Mwali)) in the middle of the southern waters of the Indian Ocean. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), the country is characterised by inter alia: i) geographical isolation; ii) a rapidly expanding population; iii) limited natural resources; iv) poor economic resilience; and v) vulnerability to sea level rise and natural disasters. The main risks come from tropical cyclones and excess rains and flooding associated with the cyclones.\n2. Comoros, Djibouti, Somalia, and South Sudan are among the poorest economies in Africa because of an extended sequence of both natural and human‑induced events that result in a series of economic shocks. The targeted countries are subject to severe droughts, flooding, and other climate‑related events that exacerbate the underlying stressors and cause economic distress. Future climate projections indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. This will have devastating consequences for human wellbeing and the livelihoods of rural people in the targeted countries. The economies are already fiscally constrained, fragile, and dependent on imports, with underdeveloped manufacturing and industries, and service sectors. These fragilities are coupled with weak infrastructure and human capacity. Djibouti, Somalia, and South Sudan are known for their long history of armed conflict, large influxes of refugees, and weak state capacity and governance. They are located in one of the world’s poorest regions, where weak infrastructure, widespread insecurity, frequent droughts, and limited livelihood opportunities condemn many people to poverty and vulnerability. These countries have experienced many social, political, and economic transformations since independence, resulting in military coups, inter‑state and civil wars, revolutions, ethnic and religious disputes, and complex humanitarian crises, among others. Some of the countries also face intra-state conflicts and other local and national grievances.\n3. Some progress has been made in socio‑economic terms in the greater HOA region, especially in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda, with major improvements in infrastructure and poverty reduction. And although growth rates in the region have, overall, been robust in recent years, countries face numerous major development challenges. The targeted countries rank near the bottom on the Human Development Index (HDI). According to the 2022 Human Development Report (HDR), Somalia and South Sudan are ranked last and second to last, respectively, on the HDI among 193 countries in the World. Comoros and Djibouti are ranked 152ⁿᵈ and 171ˢᵗ, respectively, out of 193 countries. The livelihood of most of the populations in the targeted countries is dependent on rain‑fed agriculture and pastoralism. However, farming opportunities are only available to a small part of Djibouti and Somalia, as 70% of the area is made up of arid and semi‑arid lands. Competition to access these limited natural resources is, thus, a major factor fuelling conflicts and insecurity in the region.\n4. The multi‑national project, submitted within the ADRiFi Programme Framework is aligned with the Bank’s Ten‑year Strategy (TYS, 2024‑2033) and two of the Bank's ‘High 5' priorities: \"Feed Africa\" and \"Improve the Quality of Life of Africans\". It is aligned with the Bank’s Country Strategies for the individual countries and Pillar 3 of the HOA Initiative which dwells on strengthening resilience to climatic shocks including recurrent droughts, floods, and pests, as well as conflicts, displacements, and development of the borderlands. It is aligned with the Bank’s East Africa Regional Integration Strategy Paper (EA‑RISP) for 2023-2027 whose main objective is to accelerate structural transformation, address drivers of fragility, reinforce resilience and create decent jobs. Climatic and environmental shocks have been identified by the Bank as one of the main drivers of fragility in the HOA and Comoros, in addition to conflict and violence. It is aligned with the ADF‑16 operational priorities of addressing resilience and fragility and promoting climate adaptation, the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2021 – 2025) which aims to reduce gender inequality and empower women to actively.",

"content": "5.       The Comoros is particularly vulnerable to weather and natural events, and to climate change. Th main reasons are its geographic location, being an archipelago, and its dependence on agriculture and natura resources. Additionally, Comoros is going through a fast urbanization, largely unregulated, with limited fisca ability to manage its infrastructures, limited capacity to manage disasters across the territory. Comoros i subject to hydrometeorological (tropical cyclones, floods, tsunamis) risks, which account for close to 90 percen of its vulnerabilities. The country is also exposed to other risks, including geophysical (volcanic eruptions earthquakes, landslides) and biological (cholera epidemics, dengue, chikungunya, etc.). The existin vulnerability of the Comorian population to the impacts of climate change is exacerbated by an inadequat ability to effectively prepare for, prevent, and respond to climate‑related disasters.\n6.       Djibouti experiences a semi‑desert arid tropical climate, except for the mountainous regions in th northern Gulf of Tadjourah. Over the past forty years, natural disasters have affected more than half a millio people in Djibouti (about 50% of the population), which has a high level of risk to natural hazards. The countr is susceptible to floods, droughts, heat waves, and earthquakes, and is also one of the world's most water‑scarc nations. Climate change exacerbates this issue, while sea‑level rise poses a significant threat to the country' coastline, increasing the risk of inundation and salinization, which could damage port infrastructure an tourism. From 2008 to 2011, an extended drought across Djibouti reduced the country's GDP by 4%, with farmers and livestock herders being the hardest hit. The agriculture sector lost 50% of its GDP, directl impacting over 15% of the population. Djibouti has no permanent rivers or streams, and the extrem evaporation rate further exacerbates its water scarcity. About 33% of the population lives in high hazard ris zones, while 35% of the economy is chronically vulnerable to floods and drought. Djibouti is projected t become generally hotter and drier in the future, while sea‑level rise is expected to result in the loss of significant portion of the northern and eastern coastlines. The most recent   Integrated Food Security Phas Classification (IPC) analysis indicates that about 21% of the population of Djibouti, approximately 250,00 individuals out of over 1.18 million, are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or higher). This includes 7 in an Emergency situation (Phase 4) and 14% in a Crisis situation (Phase 3). Despite food assistance from th Ministry of Social Affairs and humanitarian partners, predominantly rural populations struggle due to limite food diversity, purchasing power, and livelihood access.\n7.       Somalia continues to experience significant climate change shocks, including droughts, floods, an cyclones. The country is characterized by generally high annual temperatures of about 30°C throughout th country, with the average monthly temperatures being highest between April and June. Droughts are the mos common climate‑related disasters in Somalia, with devastating effects on the country's agriculture, livestock water resources and food security. The country's semi‑arid and arid climate, coupled with erratic rainfal patterns and high evapotranspiration rates, make it particularly susceptible to droughts. The latest drought fro 2020 to 2022 that led to five failed seasons was the longest in 40 years. The IPC analysis of July to September 2022 indicated that approximately 6.7 million people across Somalia were facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between October and December 2022. This included 2.2 million people in Emergency   situation (IPC Phase 4) and at least 300,000 people in Catastrophe situation (IPC Phase 5). The subsequent analyses in 2022 and 2023 indicated numbers above five million          facing high levels of food insecurity, attributed to drought and chronic poverty. Floods are also a significant climate risk in Somalia, with significant impacts on the country's infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods. Floods in Somalia are typically caused by heavy rainfall, often associated with tropical cyclones and the East African monsoon. Both flash floods and riverine flooding have become more common in Somalia in recent years. Flash floods are common in the northern areas, especially in low‑lying and built‑up areas. Tropical cyclones don't happen very often in",

"section": "Rationale for Bank’s Involvement",
"content": "9.       Management of climate‑related crises in Africa, including the targeted countries, has generally been reactive and while there are facilities for anticipatory planning, the response has been ex‑post. This has generally led to more fatalities, and loss of livelihoods, disruption of economic growth by damages to physical infrastructure and assets, losses from reduced production, tax revenue, budget reallocations to manage social protection programmes amidst limited liquidity for disaster response and recovery. Governments have often relied on humanitarian appeals after climate disaster events, leading to delayed response, affected population getting trapped in negative coping mechanisms and with growing climatic changes, recovery programmes addressing immediate lifesaving needs at the expense of building back better towards resilience. Such reactive approaches are expensive, slow, and place the population at risk with limited cushion unless changes are adopted towards proactive planning and management of the changing climate.\n10.      The Bank has been supporting the implementation of the ADRiFi programme in collaboration with the African Risk Capacity (ARC) over the last five years. The ADRiFi programme is currently being implemented in 15 countries and the Bank has invested over USD 100 million in the programme. The programme has protected more than five million people as of 30 December 2022 with sovereign risk insurance against severe climate hazards and enhanced anticipatory planning for climate disaster risks. Six countries (Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, The Gambia, Zambia) have so far received pay‑outs of about USD 35 million from about USD 12 million invested in premiums through the Pan‑African Risk Pool run by ARC. This helped these countries to have timely liquidity to address immediate lifesaving needs of the populations that were at risk of food insecurity, minimized the fiscal pressure and populations received timely assistance, which helped to enhance recovery and resilience. The Bank, is thus, well positioned to support the countries in the HoA region and Comoros to adopt ex‑ante risk management instruments and development climate risk management solutions to reduce the protection gap.",

"section": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION",
"content": "A. Project Development Objective\n12. The overall objective of this project is to enhance the resilience and response to climate shocks in Comoros, Djibouti, Somalia, and South Sudan by improving the management of climate disaster risks. The specific objectives are to:\n1. Create an enabling environment for the adoption of climate risk financing instruments in the targeted beneficiary countries;\n2. Improve uptake of climate and disaster risk financing in the targeted beneficiary countries and other African LDCs; and,\n3. Strengthen adaptation and resilience of the targeted beneficiary countries against climate risks.\nB. Theory of Change\n13. Climate change is perhaps the most serious pressure affecting lives and livelihoods in Comoros Djibouti, Somalia, and South Sudan. The targeted countries are vulnerable to climate‑related risks, manifested through highly variable and erratic rainfall patterns together with rising temperatures, droughts and floods that have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years. The economies and livelihoods of the targeted countries are highly dependent on rain‑fed agriculture, which is extremely sensitive to weather and climate variability. Across the HOA, at least 19.4 million people were affected by the drought which began in October 2020 and lasted until December 2022. Because of this drought, at least 7 million livestock—which pastoralist families rely upon for sustenance and livelihoods—died across the region, including more than 1.5 million in Kenya, between 2.1 million and 2.5 million in southern and south‑eastern Ethiopia, and 3 million in Somalia. Sustainable development in the region is unlikely to be achieved without addressing the climate crisis there.\n14. Despite the exposure of the targeted countries to several climate hazards, the countries do not have adequate climate risk management and adaptation mechanisms to enable them build resilience to these climate hazards. The impacts of climate shocks are exacerbated by the rampant insecurity, weak governance structures and institutional capacity. There is need to strengthen the organizational, technical, institutional, and financing arrangements for disaster risk management (DRM) in the targeted countries, enhance disaster risk knowledge to allow for effective disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities across sectors and to develop and strengthen multi‑hazard early warning systems for effective decision‑making and early actions.\n15. The theory of change for this intervention is thus three‑pronged. The first element focuses on creating an enabling environment to facilitate the adoption of ex‑ante climate risk financing instruments. This will involve enhancing knowledge and awareness of risk financing instruments, developing institutional capacity for climate risk management, and developing climate risk financing strategy for the selected countries. This will lead to a strengthened understanding of climate risk exposure and the establishment of the necessary institutional climate risk management processes and frameworks required to strengthen adaptation and addressing fragility. The second element focuses on supporting the countries to sustainably participate in the sovereign risk pool of ARC Ltd over several years. This will increase risk ownership by the governments and reduce the financial protection gap among the most vulnerable people. Thirdly, investments in climate observation and risk dissemination infrastructure will not only improve early warning capacity but also increase preparedness against future climate risks. Underpinning this theory of change are the assumptions that an increased understanding of climate risk will lead to increased interest in adopting climate risk financing strategies, including parametric risk insurance; that the developed climate risk financing strategies are implemented and financed; that climate risk data are timely and accurate; that premium payments and guarantee facility payments are made on time and insurance payouts from ARC are used in line with agreed policies to benefit the vulnerable populations.",

This amount consists of USD 8.94 million from the Global Environment Facility’s Least Developed Countries Fund (GEF ‑ LDCF), USD 8.66 million from Performance‑Based Allocation of Comoros, Djibouti, and Somalia under ADF‑16, and USD 16.20 million from the Multi‑Donor Trust Fund of the Africa Disaster Risk Financing Programme. The project activities and recipient countries are eligible for GEF‑LDCF as endorsed by the GEF Secretariat on 20 December 2023. All the financing from the Bank will be grant resources. In‑kind contribution from the beneficiary countries in‑terms of staff resources, office space and equipment are estimated at USD 1.45 million, thus bringing the total project cost to USD 35.25 million. Although the government contribution as proportion of total project costs is four percent, this increases to five percent when the regional activities executed directly by the Bank are excluded. It also makes up about 16% of the ADF contribution. Owing to the enormous climate risks faced in the HOA, there is need to mobilize additional resources for greater impact. The project team is targeting the Bank’s recently launched Climate Action Window (CAW) to mobilise additional financing for this project. If resource mobilization from the CAW is successful, this will be allocated to the components elaborated in section 2 (C) to scale‑up the interventions and development impact under the project.

Risk transfer under Component 2 will benefit the vulnerable pastoralists and crop farmers exposed to severe drought and flood events. With the resources allocated under this component, at least 400,000 pastoralists and crop farmers  are  expected  to  be  insured annually against severe climate hazards. Improvement  of  climate information  collection  and  dissemination  systems  will  be targeted  at  the National  Hydromet  agencies  and  Disaster Management agencies.\n18.

"content": "A.    Financial and Economic Analysis\n20.    The feasibility of this financing is not assessed from a Cost‑Benefit perspective as it doesn’t generate direct monetary benefits but rather from a Cost‑Effectiveness perspective of improvement of climate information services and climate disaster risk insurance. Enhancement of climate information services and risk dissemination infrastructure will increase the capacity of the government to predict climate hazards, thus saving lives and livelihoods. The data from climate services will inform forecast‑based action programmes, but also the selection of the most appropriate adaptation practices/technologies and mitigation measures to respond to climate variability and decision‑making, planning and investments of the private sector, government (local and national) and rural communities and smallholder farmers. Accurate and reliable climate data and information are critical for index‑based crop and livestock insurance which has proven to be an effective means of adaptation against climate hazards, especially drought, for smallholder farmers.\n21.     Climate disaster risk insurance aims to protect households from loss of assets and livelihoods in case of severe climate hazards by providing funding for emergency, recovery, and reconstruction support programmes. This action creates value by enabling household consumption smoothing, which cushions reductions in consumption in response to disaster‑related income shocks.     Secondly, climate disaster risk insurance reduces the need for reactive donor and sovereign spending in response to severe and low‑frequency events. This action creates value by enabling greater predictability and smoothing of donor and sovereign humanitarian spending, compared to a typical reactive humanitarian response. Thirdly, climate disaster risk insurance is intended to give greater and more effective control of resources to sovereign governments, as compared to a typical donor‑led humanitarian response, where much of the disaster response funding is channelled via United Nations agencies and largescale international NGOs. This results in increased domestic risk ownership and greater sovereignty, accountability, and sustainability in country‑level risk planning and response.\n22.    Furthermore, investment in the purchase of the ARC insurance policy generates many economic benefits for the countries such as the reduction of the countries’ financial vulnerability to extreme disaster events (due to the quick and immediate availability of funds to assist those affected and accelerate their recovery), as well as the relatively low cost of the ARC insurance premium for the countries due to their participation in the ARC insurance pool (low premium cost compared to the scenario where the countries would have to acquire coverage individually).\n23.    Alternative options for climate disaster risk insurance to address the frequent climate disasters and the different layers of risk have been considered. These options include the government setting aside contingency funds (an ex‑ante budget allocation to finance disaster response costs), establishing contingent credit mechanisms (World Bank CatDDO), emergency ex‑post budget reallocation, sovereign borrowing on an ex‑",

Evidence suggests that investments in risk transfer mechanisms, as part of disaster risk management strategies, enhance access to fast and cost‑effective liquidity for disaster‑ affected people, especially poor and vulnerable populations. Furthermore, as being able to rapidly access financial support in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is crucial to saving lives and livelihoods, disaster risk pools are emerging as a cost‑effective vehicle to help countries access rapid financing for disaster response.",

"section": "Opportunities for Building Resilience",
"content": "36.    Climate change is among the most serious pressures affecting lives and livelihoods in the HOA and Comoros. The region is highly vulnerable to variable and erratic rainfall, rising temperatures, droughts, and floods. The economies and livelihoods of countries in the region are highly dependent on rain‑fed agriculture, which is extremely sensitive to weather and climate variability. For example, Somalia has faced more than a decade of drought. South Sudan is among the five most climate‑vulnerable countries in the world and has experienced extreme flooding. Djibouti is also experienced droughts and flash floods. The Horn region is now facing its worst drought since 1981, with four consecutive failed rainy seasons. These shortages have destroyed crops, caused widespread livestock deaths, and dried up water sources in several countries across the region. The risk of natural resource‑based conflicts is ever present in the region. Vulnerable people are trapped in a cycle of chronic hunger and poverty as they lack the capacity to cope with increasing, more frequent, and intense risks and their impacts. Addressing climate change impacts in the HOA and Comoros requires integrated approaches that combine climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, sustainable development, humanitarian aid, conflict resolution and climate risk financing mechanisms. Regarding risk financing, there is a need to strengthen regional coordination mechanisms for disaster risk insurance; facilitate learning and knowledge exchange on climate disaster risk finance and insurance at the regional level; strengthen climate information systems critical for disaster risk preparedness and early warning;   promote innovative risk management mechanisms that can serve nomadic, migratory, and forcibly displaced persons across borders and promote private investment in risk financing.

"section": "Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Promotion",
"content": "37.    Climate risk insurance approaches must be tailored with gender differences in mind so that the hardest hit, specifically women, can not only survive shocks but invest in their future. They must account for the gender gap in financial inclusion, insurance, and information (in 2020, only 37 percent of African women have a bank account, compared with 48 percent of men, a gap that has only widened over the past several years). Additional challenges  to  having  a  tailored  approach  to  climate  risk  insurance  include lack  of  disaggregated  data, socioeconomic studies on impact on climate hazard on women, and lack of alternative financial instruments. Climate  risk  insurance  has  the  capacity  to  positively  impact  gender  equality  when  it  is  cognizant  of  the  challenges women face; and given that women’s insurance market is posited to reach $1.4 trillion in premiums by 2030, it is critical that climate risk insurance is responsive to women’s preferences and inclinations.\n38.    The project will, as part of strengthening enabling environment for the adoption of climate risk financing instruments, ensure risk profiles are gender sensitive, and the studies on social and financial impacts of climate hazards  are  disaggregated  by  sex  to  highlight  any  differences  by  gender.  For  the  uptake  of  sovereign  risk insurance against climate disasters in African LDCs, the number of people covered by insurance will include at least 40% female. The Guarantee Facility to be established by ARC will be subject to ARC Gender Equality Principle which states that it “intends to vigorously ensure that its operational responses and its capacity  building work have a differentiated approach to women and men”. Finally, the as part of the outcome on adaptation and resilience of African LDCs, 30% of those trained to collect analyse and disseminate climate data and information will be female to build their capacity but also involve women in decision making.

In the case of South Sudan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has been selected as a Third‑Party Implementing Agency (TPIA) in coordination with the Government of South Sudan to spearhead the implementation of activities because of the limited capacity within the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management. Under this arrangement, FAO will provide fiduciary oversight of the project, including those pertaining to procurement and financial management, in accordance with the Fiduciary Principles Agreement (FPA) signed between the Bank and FAO in 2019. The Government of South Sudan will constitute a core Project Implementation Unit made up of a Project Coordinator, a Deputy Coordinator, and a Financial Accountant to lead implementation of project activities on the Government side. This hybrid arrangement is intended to build the capacity of government staff in execution of Bank funded projects. The details of the implementation arrangements for the individual countries are found in the individual appraisal reports and accompanying technical annexes.\n41. In addition to the PIU, a Steering Committee will be established in each country to provide strategic guidance throughout the implementation of the project. The steering committee will be composed of representatives of relevant Ministries and Government Agencies responsible for making decisions on climate and disaster risk financing, planning and response. The steering committee will convene twice a year. The details of the Composition of Steering Committees are provided in the individual country reports.\n42. A Premium Guarantee Support Facility (PGSF) Trust will be established at ARC Ltd within one year after project approval to support ARC LDC Member States that have formally committed to pay premiums for ARC insurance policies, but where payment is delayed due to sovereign government invoice payment processes. Participating countries will enter into a separate agreement with the PGSF, creating a legal obligation on the country to repay the premium advance within a specific time‑period – back to the PGSF Trust, to replenish it. Eligibility, selection criteria, and prioritization of countries for the PGSF will be further developed through a detailed concept note with ARC Ltd that will detail the governance, structure, enforcement, and expenses of the Trust.\n43.
