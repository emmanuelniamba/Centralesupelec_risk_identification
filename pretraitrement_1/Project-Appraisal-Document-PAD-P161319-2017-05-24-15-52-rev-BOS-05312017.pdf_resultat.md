"section": "STRATEGIC CONTEXT",
"content": "A. Country Context\n1.      Solomon   Islands is a  remote   archipelago  with  one  of  the  lowest  population  densities (20 persons/km²) and urbanization rates (17     percent) in the world. The country      consists of 997 islands encompassing a total land area of 29,900 km² spread over 1.34 million km² of ocean. The population of approximately 616,000 is dispersed across an estimated 90 islands.¹ The island geography, coupled with weak infrastructure links, presents formidable challenges to service delivery and economic integration. Major obstacles to development are the high cost environment resulting from the country’s remoteness as well as its small market, lack of competition, high transportation and energy costs, and customary land issues. It is also vulnerable to natural disasters such as cyclones, tsunamis, flooding, drought and earthquakes.\n2.      Solomon Islands has one of the lowest levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita among the Pacific Island states, at US$2,013/capita. The country  is still recovering from many years  of intermittent political turmoil and civil strife. Locally referred to as the “tension”, the conflict during 1998-2003 disrupted the functioning of state and social institutions which resulted in a 40 percent decline of GDP. To support the stabilization of Solomon Islands, neighboring countries led by Australia deployed the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands to restore law and order and other basic state functions. Ever since, peace has generally been maintained, barring major riots in 2006 (which did not trigger further conflict), and political protests in 2011 following a change in prime minister.\n3.      The economy has    since rebounded, but remains vulnerable to external shocks. Solomon Islands Government (SIG) managed its economy pursuant to the agreed principles of the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA) set up to support the recovery of the Solomon Islands, and the economy grew mainly on export of commodities such as logging and substantial amounts of Official Development Assistance. However, the global financial crisis of 2009 hit the Solomon Islands hard, resulting in GDP contracting by 4.7 percent, a budget crunch and a depletion of foreign currency reserves. Furthermore, the oil price spike of 2008, and subsequently during 2011 to 2013, demonstrated Solomon Islands’ vulnerability to global oil price volatility as the country’s balance of payments came under severe pressure since fossil fuels account for about a quarter of all imports.\n4.      Going forward, real GDP is projected to grow on average by 3.1 percent over the medium-term (in the next 5 years). This projection is based on the assumption of resumed gold-mining activity, the exploitation of  large  nickel deposits,  and  increased  investments   in  key  transport  infrastructure, energy,  and telecommunications projects. There are considerable down-side risks to this outlook, notably the expected decline in log production over the medium-term.\n          1 Population data based on Solomon Islands 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey – National Analytical Report [Volume 1], October 2015.",

"content": "5.     Low access to electricity services. About 9 percent of the population in Solomon Islands has access to grid-connected electricity supplied by the national power utility, Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA), and about 2 percent are supplied by diesel generators owned by households or communities.² Access to grid electricity is uneven across the country. About 50 percent of the urban households are supplied by SIEA of which the majority are being supplied through the Honiara Electricity System (HES) in the capital city, with a population of nearly 70,000, on the main island of Guadalcanal. Only about 3 percent of the rural households are supplied by SIEA or through diesel generators owned by households or communities. Nationally, one-third of the households have installed small solar home systems, with photovoltaic (PV) panels typically of 20 watts, which are only sufficient for a few light bulbs and to charge cell phones. At an average annual consumption of 125 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per capita, the country has the lowest energy consumption rate in the Pacific.\n6.     Demand and supply.    Currently the demand growth on the HES is constrained by interruptions in supply caused by frequent maintenance of diesel generators, limited distribution network coverage, small number of overall customers and high retail tariffs (see section below). The total installed capacity of the HES is 33.6 megawatts (MW), out of which 32.6 MW³ are diesel generators and 1 MW is a solar farm. Peak demand of the HES has increased from 9.3 MW in 2003 to 15.5 MW in 2016 representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 4.0 percent. Over the same period, annual electricity generation in HES grew at 4.9 percent CAGR from 45.1 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 83.9 GWh, with a notable 6.7 percent growth in 2016 alone mainly due to the increased generation capacity realized through the commissioning of four 2.5 MW diesel generators. Total electricity generated in the provincial grids was 6.7 GWh in 2016.\n7.     Heavy reliance on imported diesel, high cost of generation and high retail tariff.    SIEA’s system  is almost 100 percent reliant on diesel generation. The cost of generation has reduced over the recent years, from US$ 35.6 cents/kWh in 2014 to US$ 23.8 cents/kWh in 2016, along with the drop in oil prices. Retail tariffs for grid-supplied electricity, adjusted down from US$ 93 cents/kWh in 2014 to US$ cent 65/kWh as of January 2017. The 2017 reduction was partly due to low oil prices, and partly due to enforcement of a new tariff calculation methodology. The Tariff Regulation mechanism adopted since 2005 linked retail tariffs to fuel cost. However, while the retail tariff increased along with rising oil prices up to mid-2014, the drop in fuel cost which began in late-2014 was largely not translated into lower retail tariffs. In 2014, SIEA, with the support of the World Bank, conducted a cost-of-service and tariff review in order to develop recommendations on SIEA’s future revenue requirements and its electricity tariff. The cost-of-service and tariff review was completed in 2016 which resulted in the development and gazetting of the Tariff Regulation 2016, which came into effect in January 2017. Through the new tariff methodology, tariff levels are set by determining the Maximum Allowable Revenue for SIEA based on Non Fuel Revenue Requirements and a pass-through of Fuel Charges of all fuel costs, including power purchased under power purchase agreements, adjusted for heat rate and losses. However, the retail tariff is still significantly higher than the Pacific regional average of residential retail tariffs.",

Electricity sales revenues increased from SBD351.5 million in 2011 to SBD433.5 million in 2016, while the cost of generation kept going down, largely due to lower oil prices, from US$ 35.6 cents/kWh in 2014 to",

"content": "Beyond the aims of lower cost of electricity, the Solomon Islands National Energy Policy (SINEP) aims to enhance energy security at a national level, by increasing the share of renewable energy to 50 percent of total installed capacity by 2020. SINEP estimates the country’s hydropower potential to be 300 MW, but past attempts to develop hydropower in Guadalcanal to supply Honiara were abandoned due to customary land issues and challenging geological conditions. While SIEA is preparing to develop the 500 kilowatt (kW) Fiu River Hydropower Project in Malaita with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), TRHDP will be the first large hydropower project in the country according to the SIEA’s least-cost expansion plan. SINEP estimates the solar irradiation to be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 kWh/m²/day, and with the timing of its peak output coinciding with the daily peak load at mid-day, solar energy is regarded as a promising source of energy. In addition to SIEA’s 1 MW grid-connected solar farm commissioned in 2016, SIEA plans to incrementally develop similar size installations. However, a significant constraint to developing solar farms in the Solomon Islands is the difficulty of acquiring land in a country where approximately 90 percent of the land is customary. Other alternatives such as geothermal, wind and biomass have been examined, but do not currently offer cost-effective alternatives to hydropower and solar energy.",

Retail tariff is nationally uniform and is regulated by MMERE, and there is a cross-subsidy between the HES customers with relatively lower cost of supply and the customers of the outer islands with higher generation costs mainly due to the high cost of transporting fuel. Since an independent regulatory authority does not exist in the Solomon Islands, SIEA also advises SIG on regulatory instruments, and is given the authority to issue licenses to entities who wish to generate and distribute electricity in areas not supplied by SIEA.",

"content": "14. Solomon Islands’ 2016-35 National Development Strategy (NDS) places emphasis on private sector-led investment and growth, and the promotion of renewable energy. To mitigate the impact of high cost diesel fuel, SIG adopted a policy to develop domestic sources of energy, particularly hydropower and other renewables. At the same time, since the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA) placed a moratorium on new loans, public financing of larger infrastructure projects was made very difficult. While this moratorium has since been lifted, it gave an initial impetus to the drive for private sector participation in infrastructure development, financing and operation - a policy that was later embedded in NDS 2011-2020, and inherited in the new NDS 2016-2035 promulgated in April 2016\n15. TRHDP is a national priority under the Solomon Islands National Infrastructure Investment Plan (NIIP). NIIP presents an integrated plan for development priorities of key infrastructure sectors, including electricity, and supports SIG’s development strategy by helping to: (i) ease constraints to growth through the provision of lower cost and reliable electricity; (ii) facilitate private sector development; and (iii) promote clean energy development and enhance energy security by substituting diesel power generation by hydropower. Through a multi-criteria analysis, NIIP selected TRHDP as one of the strategic priority investments for the Solomon Islands.\n16. TRHDP is critical for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and for SIG to achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) commitment. SIG’s INDC is to reduce GHG by 18,800 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂eq) per year by 2025 and by 31,125 tCO₂eq per year by 2030. With an installed capacity of 15 MW, TRHDP is expected to annually generate, on average, 78.35 GWh of clean renewable energy to displace equivalent amount of energy to be generated by current and future diesel generators. This would be roughly 68 percent of the annual demand forecast for 2022. Applying the default grid emission factor of 650 tCO₂eq/GWh for a 100 percent diesel-based system, the net GHG emission reduction potential of the Project is 49,500 tCO₂eq per year after deducting potential emissions during construction, land clearing, and the reservoir. This is more than twice the INDC target for 2025.",

"section": "Project Alignment and Objectives",
"content": "17.   TRHDP is aligned with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2013-2017 and other Bank operations. The World Bank Group’s CPS is structured around two engagement areas: strengthening economic resilience and improving public service provision. The Project supports the Bank’s engagement on economic resilience by easing constraints to growth, leveraging private capital and promoting climate friendly growth. In particular, the Project will support CPS outcome # 5 of lower cost and reliable electricity from cleaner energy sources. The Project, through provision of lower cost electricity, will also strengthen SIEA’s performance and contribute to the objectives of SISEP.\n18.   TRHDP supports the World Bank corporate twin goals of reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity for the poorest 40 percent of the population. The impact of TRHDP on the retail electricity tariff is expected to be significant. From an average retail tariff of US$ 65 cents/kWh in 2017, in its first year of operations in 2022 TRHDP is expected to help reduce electricity retail tariff to about US$ 33 cents/kWh. By 2052, retail tariff levels are expected to reach US$ 26 cents/kWh. By reducing the cost of power supply, the TRHDP would make electricity more affordable to lower income households, lowering the barrier for new households to connect to the grid. This would enable these households to lower their expenditures on electricity and enhance their income earning capacity through use of power for productive and social purposes. Lower costs of power would also reduce the costs of doing business for small and medium enterprises, thus increasing profits and stimulating investment and job creation leading to increased prosperity for lower income households. It should be noted that the reduced cost of supply in Honiara (and its suburbs as the grid is extended) will also benefit customers in the outer islands through a lower national uniform electricity tariff.\n19.   The Project is consistent with the World Bank Group’s “cascade” approach to infrastructure finance. Given the limited public resources and large scale investment needed by TRHDP, the SIG decided to solicit private investments and commercial financing for the TRHDP. Through a competitive process supported with IFC advisory services, a pre-qualified international developer was invited for negotiations on the needed PPA tariff to make the project financially viable and attractive to private investment. It was initially envisaged that the sponsor would arrange commercial loans whereas the Bank would support the Project with a guarantee of SIG’s obligation in favor of commercial lenders financing the Project Company (PC). However, due to the high investment cost given the inherent high cost environment of the Solomon Islands, it was determined that the PPA tariff will be too high for SIEA and its customers under this structure. To make TRHDP financially attractive to reputable international developers to bring private equity and the capacity to construct and operate the Project, while also reducing the PPA tariff to ultimately lowering the retail tariff for the consumers, SIG decided to request concessional public financing to support the Project. The Bank was instrumental in supporting SIG in preparing a robust project and in arranging concessional financing. In addition, the sponsors have requested for insurance provided by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The “four-point cover” provided by MIGA, including insurance against non-transferability, political violence, expropriation and breach of contract, provides the sponsors with the confidence required to invest and to enter into a long-term PPA in a country with no such precedents.",

"section": "PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE",
"content": "A. PDO\nThe project development objective (PDO) is to increase the share of renewable energy through hydropower in Solomon Islands.\nB. Project Beneficiaries\n20. The direct beneficiaries of the Project are SIEA and its residential, commercial and industrial customers who will benefit from a lower national uniform electricity tariff resulting from the proposed TRHDP. Individual households, public and private enterprises, will have the opportunity to apply the savings to other uses such as education and business expansion. Household disposable income is expected to increase, particularly in the project area, due to jobs during construction, improved road access, royalties and benefit sharing investments. During the extensive community consultations conducted during project preparations, community members expressed interest in a range of benefits from the project including job acquisition and skills development, improved access to schools and markets for goods as a result of the road, opportunities for connections to the electricity grid as a result of the transmission lines, service delivery improvement, eco-tourism and business development activities. Business activity at a national level is expected to grow with investment enabled by significant electricity cost savings. Furthermore, a reduction in the cost of electricity supply will improve the financial performance of SIEA and thereby provide the utility with more resources to finance system expansion and maintain existing assets, therefore, indirectly improving the population’s access to electricity and the reliability of its supply. Furthermore, the Project-financed access road will improve mobility of people and goods in the surrounding communities.\n21. The proposed Project is expected to have wider transformational benefits beyond the power sector. As the first major build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) scheme invested by a foreign investor, and as an example of successful introduction of innovative approaches to acquiring community-owned customary land and obtaining social acceptance. The Project will also set an example for risk sharing arrangements and help improve the investment environment for international private finance.\n22. In addition, the benefit-sharing mechanism expected to be introduced in conjunction with the Project, with separate financing but coordinated implementation arrangements, will demonstrate how host communities can also benefit equitably from large-scale natural resources development projects and enhance prospects for sustainability.\nC. PDO-Level Results Indicators\n23. Progress will be measured against the following PDO level results indicators, as applicable:\n\ta. Generation capacity of hydropower constructed under the Project (MW);\n\tb. Share of hydropower in the generation mix (%); and\n\tc. Electricity generated by the Project (GWh).",

"section": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION",
"content": "A. Project Components\n   24.    The Project has the following unique, transformational characteristics: increase of renewable energy generation in HES from 1 percent in 2016 to 85 percent in 2022 (with 68 percent from the Project and the remainder from expected solar); GHG reduction of more than twice the entire INDC commitment; the first utility-scale hydropower project; perhaps the largest investment project in the country; the first BOOT project to be invested by international private sponsors; understanding and sharing risks between public and private sectors; introduction of a benefit-sharing mechanism to benefit the wider community; and an unique land acquisition process which distributes compensation and royalties equally to all members of newly established tribal cooperatives and establishes a joint government-landowner land management company. All of these factors will help build private sector confidence to invest in large-scale investment projects, in particular, infrastructure, in the Solomon Islands.\n   25.    The World Bank Group has mobilized a range of resources and instruments to enable the Government to attract an experienced international hydropower developer to construct and operate the hydropower facility (HPF), and to enhance the quality and viability of the Project. The IFC Advisory Service has played a leading role in supporting SIG to attract a private developer through an international competitive process and negotiation with a pre-qualified bidder. IDA has provided extensive technical support to SIG to undertake feasibility, safeguard, and other preparation studies, and to engage world-class experts to help SIG design an attractive investment project. IDA also assisted SIG to mobilize concessional financing to cover majority of the project cost once it had become clear that even with an IDA Guarantee the cost of private financing would endanger the financial viability of the Project.¹⁰ To address the risks inherent in investing in a relatively untested investment environment with a recent history of political unrest, a MIGA insurance has also been requested by the private sponsors of the PC: Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water) and Hyundai Engineering Co. Ltd. (HEC).¹¹ While the volume of private equity mobilized is limited, the private sponsors bring vast experience on hydropower development and operation to the Solomon Islands, and add certainty over the cost and sustainability of the Project. By having the sponsors being responsible for the construction and operation of the HPF, the risk of poor quality construction and operation is significantly reduced compared to an arrangement where an inexperienced public entity would be the implementing entity.\n   26.    The TRHDP will consist of four components: (i) HPF; (ii) access road; (iii) transmission lines; and (iv) TA. In terms of timing, the TA component is expected to begin first in order to maintain continuity of the TRHDP Project Office (PO) with the preparation phase and to support the other project components. Implementation of the access road would proceed ahead of construction of the HPF to facilitate access to the dam and powerhouse sites. Construction of the transmission lines will come last. Construction of the HPF would begin in 10 Assuming commercial loan of 7.5% interest with maturity of 16 years including 4-year grace period, the levelized cost of the Project with commercial loan will be nearly double that of the level attainable with concessional financing being arranged for the Project.\n          11 The “private sponsors” will be K-water and HEC, both of which will hold shares in the Project Company. K-water and HEC qualify as Private Entities for the sake of the World Bank Performance Standards even though K-water is publicly owned.",

"content": "31.    The total project cost is estimated at US$240.48 million. This is expensive for a 15 MW hydropower\n plant even if considering that the civil works are designed for 20 MW to accommodate the fourth 5 MW unit\n when demand increases.\n 32.    Component 1 HPF: The total cost for Component 1 is estimated at US$185.66 million. The largest cost\n item is the proposed Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) price of US$140.0 million excluding taxes\n (under negotiation with K-water and HEC). For the same scope, excluding access road and transmission lines,\n the Feasibility Study estimated the cost to be approximately US$124.5 million in 2014, which was verified by an\n independent cost estimator recommended by the DSAP. The proposed EPC price is 12.5 percent higher than\n the Feasibility Study estimate. The proposed EPC price has also been reviewed by SIEA’s own international\n consulting firm in March 2017 who, through an independent cost estimate, concluded that the offered price is\n adequate assuming a reasonable levels of profit and overhead cost, and factoring in that HEC will be taking\n majority of the construction-related geological risks.\n 33.    Other notable costs include development costs of US$20.7 million and contingencies of US$16.7 million.\n The development costs include PC operation cost and cost of advisors during the 4-year construction period,\n including the estimated cost of the Owner’s Engineer currently at US$3.5 million. While these costs will\n continue to be negotiated, it is also important to ensure sufficient costs are allocated to ensure quality\n construction and full compliance with environmental and social management requirements.\n 34.    Component 2 Access Road: The estimated cost of US$ 25.0 million is based on the detailed design being\n executed by SIG’s international consulting firm and ongoing negotiations with the sponsors.\n 35.    Component 3 Transmission Line: The cost of US$22.82 million is based on estimates made by an\n international consulting firm contracted by SIEA to prepare a detailed concept design, which included\n assessment of different routes and requirements to upgrade the connection point (i.e. Lungga Power Station)\n to accommodate the 66 kV voltage connection. This study was completed in November 2016.\n 36.    Due to the inherent high cost environment of the Solomon Islands, further exacerbated by the complex\n technical conditions to develop a major hydropower plant, financing costs associated with commercial loans\n would have made the Project financially unviable. SIG, therefore, requested IDA and other financiers to provide\n concessional financing for it to on-lend to the PC and SIEA with a nominal spread. SIG, through its main public\n investment vehicle, the Investment Corporation of Solomon Islands (ICSI), will also be a shareholder of the PC\n whereby ICSI will only require a marginal return on its equity in an effort to reduce the PPA tariff.\n 37.

Hydropower projects are often contracted to a private investor under an energy (i.e. per kWh) payment PPA, where the investor takes the hydrological risk. However, since the investor must ensure a revenue stream to service its debt, perform necessary maintenance and secure its return on equity, the PPA energy tariff is based on the energy that is assessed to be produced at all times with a high degree of confidence (‘primary energy’). While the excess energy (‘secondary energy’) is priced lower, the off-taker is paying additionally on top of the revenue the investor has secured to meet its obligations through sales of ‘primary energy’. Therefore, the investor is not fully taking on the hydrological risk. For TRHDP, particularly due to the very limited availability of hydrological data, a net available capacity payment modality.",

As a majority of the project financing will be provided through SIG, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will play an instrumental role in coordinating the provision of financing from various sources.   A donor coordination mechanism, led by the Bank, is expected to be established for reporting and information sharing between SIG and donors, and among donors.\n   43.   Component 1     will be implemented by the PC. K-water and HEC will enter into a shareholders’ agreement with ICSI to establish the PC which is still under negotiation.\n   44.   Under the PPA, the PC will contract an EPC contractor (expected to be HEC) for the construction of the HPF and the access road (Component 2), and an O&M contractor (expected to be K-water) for the operation of the HPF and Lot 2 of the access road. After HPF commissioning, Lot 1 of the access road will be maintained by SIG. The EPC contract, in particular, will be a fixed-price contract whereby the EPC contractor will assume majority of the construction-related geological risks. The PC will contract an Owner’s Engineer to supervise the EPC contract.\n   45.   The PC will enter into an Implementation Agreement (IA) with SIG which will specify the roles and responsibilities of each party, for example, SIG’s responsibility to provide land for the Project and guarantee foreign exchange convertibility. The PC will also enter into a Government Guarantee Agreement (GGA) also with SIG in which SIG guarantees the payment obligations of SIEA under the PPA. The PC will enter into a Lease Agreement with the Tina Core Land Company (TCLC; to be established) with respect to the land it owns, which is necessary for the implementation of Component 1 and part of Component 2 of the Project.\n   46.   The PC and SIEA will jointly recruit and finance an Independent Engineer to ensure that the HPF is designed and constructed in adherence with the provisions of the PPA. In addition, PO will retain the DSAP under Component 4 to ensure that design, construction and operation of the HPF meet required safety standards.

The benefit-sharing mechanism is not a component under the Project. However, it will be supported under an associated project for which SIG requested financing from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) administered by the Bank. The PO will be the implementing entity to ensure consistency and seamless coordination with the Project. A benefit-sharing mechanism is an arrangement to share the Project’s benefit with the wider community, and is expected to be implemented throughout the PPA operation period. The JSDF program is intended to bring the sharing of the benefits forward by implementing community development investments during the Project construction period. In the event JSDF funding does not materialize, SIG has agreed to seek alternative resources to implement the benefit-sharing mechanism during the construction period. The detailed mechanism to be implemented during Project operation will also be devised during Project construction. Implementation of this benefit sharing mechanism is expected to provide an example for the development of similar arrangements in the Solomon Islands and elsewhere.",

"section": "KEY RISKS",
"content": "A. Overall Risk Rating and Explanation of Key Risks\n   64.    The overall implementation risk is High as this is a complex project being implemented in a fragile, low\n   capacity environment with no previous experience constructing or operating a large-scale HPF. These main risks\n   are being shared between the shareholders in the PC (with K-water maintaining management control) and SIG,\n   with construction risks also being built in through the fixed-price EPC contract. The following are the key risks\n   roughly  in  sequential  order,  from   the  pre-construction  through   construction  and   operation  after\n   commissioning.\n   65.    Need   for  concurrent  negotiations   of  Project design,  implementation,    financing  and   equity\n   arrangement.      The implementation of Components 1 and 2 and their financing by the Government, K-water\n   and HEC are designed as a project finance structure¹², where a special purpose Project Company is set up to\n   carry out these activities, and where the overall cost incurred for the establishment of the PC and the\n   implementation of its activities is paid by the income generated by Components 1 and 2 of the Project. This\n   means that each aspect of the cost of the Project (including the cost of construction and operation, as well as\n   the terms and conditions of its financing, tax regime and other inputs) and its income (the tariff) has an impact\n   on the whole Project: none of them can be dealt with independently from the others. This is the reason why\n   the negotiations of the legal agreements for Project financing (i.e. the IDA Financing Agreement and Project\n   Agreements) must take place at the same time as the negotiations of the Project Documents (i.e. Power\n   Purchase  Agreement,    Implementation   Agreement,   etc.), instead  of  finalizing the Project design  and\n   implementation first and then the financing documents, as is common practice in most Bank-supported IPF\n   projects. The various Project financiers, including IDA, need to confirm the availability of their financing and\n   their financial terms, through Board approval, before the other elements of the Project costs and income can\n   be finalized. Once those elements are all finally agreed, the financiers can confirm their assessment of the\n   economic and legal aspects of the Project (which are estimates only, until the finalization of costs and income)\n   and enter into their respective financing agreements. This is not due to a lack of readiness of the Project, but\n   rather a reflection of the process of project financing preparation.\n   66.    In order to mitigate this sequencing issue, World Bank Management has waived the requirement\n   specified in Paragraph 28 of BP 10.00 of the Operational Manual, allowing Board approval on the basis of the\n   negotiated term sheet attached as Annex 4 of the PAD, instead of negotiated legal agreements. The provisions\n   of the Financing Agreement to be entered into between IDA and the Solomon Islands, the Project Agreement to\n   be entered into between IDA and the PC once it will have been established and the Project Agreement to be\n   entered into between IDA and SIEA, will be finalized after Board approval. If the finalization of the legal\n   agreements after Board approval results in substantial changes to the term sheet previously approved by the\n   Board, Management will resubmit the proposal to the Executive Directors for approval of the changes.\n   67.    This different sequencing between finalization of the legal agreements and Board approval does not\n   carry additional risk. It allows the Government and its partners to structure the Project, give other financiers\n   the confidence to also seek approval of their respective financing and confirm their financial terms, finalize the\n          12 As opposed to a corporate finance structure, where the repayment of the Project is made from the overall\n          owners’ assets.",

This means that the implementation arrangements for the Project may be delayed or concluded on a basis which ultimately differs from what is expected at the time of the IDA Board. It is not unusual for this type of Project to negotiate the Project Documents after the availability of the financing is confirmed in principle (but before the financing agreements are finalized and signed). This is especially important when, as is the case, the confirmation of the cost of financing is an important element of the discussion between the Government and the sponsors.

"content": "The Project is financially viable under the proposed financing structure. The PPA between the PC and SIEA is expected to be structured on a net available capacity, and will ensure a return on equity required by K-water and HEC, and a nominal return for SIG to service its IDA Credit. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the PC is estimated to be 3.4 percent, which is above its 2.6 percent Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). A minimum DSCR of 1.12 is projected to be maintained during the debt repayment period.",

"section": "Distributional Analysis",
"content": "The distributional analysis of the project shows broad based gains from the Project to different stakeholders. Since electricity from the Project is expected to be cheaper than electricity generated using the counterfactual, SIEA is one of the major beneficiaries of the Project. A significant share of these financial benefits can be expected to be passed onto SIEA’s customers in the form of retail tariff reductions. According to the Bank’s Corporate Financial Analysis of SIEA, the Project is expected to help reduce electricity retail tariffs, in 2016 prices, to about US$ 33 cents/kWh immediately after Project commissioning and to US$26 cents/kWh by 2052 after handing over of the HPF to SIG. Local communities benefit through the benefit sharing mechanism while K-water and HEC receive their required return on equity. Development partners collectively help bear the costs of the Project by providing financing for the project at a rate that is significantly below than the market rate. SIG would help to improve financial viability if it provides tax exemptions to the Project.\nFigure 1: Distribution of Costs and Benefits among Stakeholders\n150                                                                                     71\n100\n50      19         135                    13                     28          43\n0\nNPV, $USm\n-50                                                  -35\n-100                              -105\n-150\nProject   Sol.

"content": "In 2016, SIEA marked its sixth year of positive financials, with a net profit of SBD 205 million (US$24.7 million). Table 5 provides a summary of the audited financial statements of SIEA over 2011 - -2016.\nThe key components to SIEA's Operating Income are, Electricity Sales and Grant Income. Over the 2011-2016 period, electricity sales revenues have increased from a level of SBD 351.5 million in 2011 to SBD 437.5 million in 2016, marking an average annual growth of 4 percent. It is important to note that between 2014-15 and 2015-16, electricity sales revenues actually decreased by 1.5 percent and by 0.5 percent, respectively, despite increases in the volumes sold in the same period. This decrease in revenues was due to an average tariff reduction from SBD 6.77/kWh (US$ 93 cents/kWh) in 2014, to SBD 6.59/kWh (US$ 84 cents/kWh) in 2015, to SBD 6.22/kWh (US$ 80 cents/kWh) in 2016.",

"content": "“without TRHDP” projections, tariff reductions were significantly less generous than in the “with TRHDP” scenario (i.e., tariff reduction of 10 percent per year for the period 2017-2021, and 5 percent for 2022-2052) and led to a deterioration of SIEA’s profitability with an average net margin of around 10 percent.\nWith the benefit of additional assumptions on operational efficiency, losses, input costs, overheads, depreciation, and financing costs, SIEA’s Projected Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Balance Sheet were built and are presented in Tables 7 and 8.\nSIEA’s average EBITDA margin is expected to grow from 24 percent to 53 percent, and Net Margin from 14 percent to 43 percent, over the projection period. SIEA’s liquidity ratio is strong, with a minimum of 3.70 in 2020, largely driven by the strong cash position. Over the projection period, SIEA’s average annual cash from operations is of SBD 442 million and allows financing of capex investments with internal cash generation. SIEA’s debt gearing is very low at an average of 11:89. At its highest level of debts, in 2021, SIEA’s gearing is still heavily inclined towards use of equity at a debt/equity ratio of 36:64. As a result, SIEA maintains strong DSCR throughout, with lowest DSCR, in 2024 at 1.43. This is still a healthy DSCR which provides SIEA an average Return on Equity of 6 percent, over the period.",

"content": "The hydropower potential of the Tina River to supply the growing electricity demand was first identified through the Bank’s Guadalcanal Renewable Development Concept Study in 2006, and was followed by SIG’s pre-feasibility study. Subsequently, a feasibility study was prepared for the Project in three phases between 2010 and 2015 targeting different sites along the Tina River. Based on geotechnical investigations and recommendations of DSAP, it was decided to select Site 7C for the full feasibility study under Phase 3 which was completed in November 2014 and later updated with additional hydrological data by November 2015.\n\nTwo alternative analyses conducted independently by SIEA and the Bank found TRHDP to be part of the least-cost generation plan to satisfy the growing demand. Against the backdrop of lower global oil prices, dramatically reduced PV costs and improvements in battery storage technologies since the time the Project was conceived, alternative analyses were conducted independently by SIEA and the Bank in 2016-2017 to confirm the viability of the Project. Both studies concluded that the Project is the least-cost alternative for HES. While the cost of solar has been reducing drastically, high penetration of variable renewable energy sources such as solar requires enabling technologies to compensate for their intermittency and to supply electricity during the night and during consecutive cloudy days. TRHDP can store energy in its reservoir and provide frequency regulation and spinning reserve functions to complement solar. Diesel generation can also provide such functions, but is expensive and emits GHG; and while battery storage is a promising technology, it is still expensive. The “without TRHDP” and “with TRHDP” comparison conducted under the Bank’s analysis found that the solar penetration is higher in the “without TRHDP” scenario (58 percent of total demand in 2046) compared to the “with TRHDP” scenario (40 percent of total demand in 2046). However, since TRHDP generates 43 percent of the demand in 2046 under the “with TRHDP” scenario, the total share of renewable energy will become 83 percent “with TRHDP”.",

Under the Bank’s OP/BP 10 with respect to projects financed by the Bank, the borrower and implementing agency are required to maintain financial management systems – including accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems – adequate to ensure they can provide the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding the project resources and expenditures. An assessment of PC capacity could not be conducted as the entity has not yet been established. The assessment of MMERE and SIEA concluded that the proposed FM arrangements of these implementing entities satisfy the requirements of OP/BP 10 subject to the effective implementation of recommended risk mitigating measures. The main FM risks are: that the equity funding under Component I will not be used for the intended purpose, consistent with the PDO; payments for major civil works under Components 1, 2 & 3 do not meet acceptable technical standards or are misused; and the lack of capacity within MMERE. The recommended mitigation measures are detailed in Annex 2.",

A Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) was prepared as the basis for procurement arrangements and planning of Components 3 and 4. Key procurement risks are: (a) lack of procurement and contract management capacity, and (b) limited number of local suppliers/contractors. Risk mitigation measures have been discussed and agreed with government and detailed in Annex 2. For Components 1 and 2, the sponsor selection process followed by SIG was reviewed by the World Bank and found to be substantially consistent with the Core Procurement Principles of the Bank’s New Procurement Framework, including the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 3.14 to 3.17 (Conflict of Interest) and Paragraphs 3.21 to 3.23 (Eligibility) of the Procurement Regulation. Provisions on Anti-Corruption specified in Paragraph 3.32 of the Procurement Regulations will be included into all the agreements and contracts between the project sponsors and SIG. The final draft agreements and contracts between the project sponsor and SIG will be subject to prior review by the World Bank before signing. As such, the PC is permitted to use its own procedures for the procurement of goods, works, non-consulting services and/or consulting services from eligible sources. MMERE will submit a Contract Management Plan for Components 1 and 2 in accordance with Annex XI of the Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers.

"content": "The project is categorized as environmental Category A and has triggered for component 1 the World Bank Performance Standards – the dam, reservoir, and power station in accordance with OP 4.03 Performance Standards for Private Sector Activities, since these activities will be executed by a private sector entity. Bank Operational Policies for safeguards apply to Components 3 and 4, because agencies of SIG will execute them. In addition to the social safeguard policies indicated above, the Bank’s safeguard policies on Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, and Forests will be triggered. MMERE has commissioned a single ESIA for all four components, which covers the HPF, the access road and transmission line. MMERE engaged an Environmental and Social Panel of experts to advise on ESIA preparation and other environmental and social matters. The ESIA was initially disclosed both in country and on the Bank’s external website on August 15, 2016. MMERE held consultations for communities and NGOs in October and November 2016, and a revised ESIA draft was disclosed January 27, 2017. The ESIA and the ESMP, which are included in the same document, provide a comprehensive identification of the project’s social and environmental impacts and recommended mitigation measures for them. The following are the potential environmental impacts identified in the ESIA as being of most concern. Alterations in downstream hydrology and water quality.   In the absence of planned mitigations, the 5.7 km reach of the river that will be bypassed by the tunnel between dam and powerhouse would be dry (except for minor inflow from small tributaries) other than during flood events large enough to cause releases via the dam spillway. The operator will be required to maintain an environmental flow of 1 m³/s below the dam, which the ESIA predicts is the minimum to mitigate loss of aquatic habitat and to allow fish movement in the dam-to-powerhouse reach.   The operator will also maintain a minimum flow through the powerhouse at all times of day, and throughout the year of 2.43 m³/s (equivalent to the minimum generating discharge through one turbine) to maintain habitat in the wider channel downstream and reduce the range of flow fluctuations between periods of peak generation and reservoir refilling. Mitigation measures will be supplemented or modified on the basis of monitoring of water quality, fish populations, and aquatic invertebrates. Daily transitions from generation to non-generation would cause fluctuations in water flow downstream of the tailrace. Impacts could include loss of habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms, changes in fish spawning and migration behavior, abrupt changes in river level, and reduced availability of water for drinking and other human uses. Dam safety is being incorporated in the design and the operating plans in accordance with PS 4, under the guidance of a DSAP for which the terms of reference are based on OP 4.37 Safety of Dams. Obstruction of fish migration. Most of the fish species found during ESIA baseline surveys in the river near the dam and reservoir sites and in the upper reach of the river are migratory.    The main mitigation measure in the ESMP, a “trap and haul” system, was selected as a practical, relatively low-cost option that has been proposed.",

"section": "ANNEX 1: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION",
"content": "COUNTRY: Solomon Islands\nTina River Hydropower Development Project\n1.     The power sector of the Solomon Islands can be characterized by its low electrification rate, heavy reliance on diesel generation and high retail tariff. Within the Pacific region, Solomon Islands has the lowest grid-connected electrification rate of 11 percent, lowest consumption at 125 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per capita, second highest percentage of total fuel imports at 20 percent of GDP, and the highest retail tariff at over US$ cent 65/kWh as of January 2017. About 50 percent of the urban households are supplied by SIEA of which the majority are being supplied through the Honiara Electricity System (HES) in the capital city, with a population of nearly 70,000, on the main island of Guadalcanal. Only about 3 percent of the rural households is supplied by SIEA or through diesel generators owned by households or communities. Nationally, one-third of the households have installed small solar home systems, with photovoltaic (PV) panels typically of 20 watts, which are only sufficient for a few light bulbs and to charge cell phones.\n2.     The total installed capacity of the HES is 33.6 megawatts (MW), out of which 32.6 MW are diesel generators and a 1 MW solar farm. Peak demand of the HES has increased from 9.3 MW in 2003 to 15.5 MW in 2016 representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.0 percent. Over the same period, annual electricity generation in HES grew at 4.9 percent CAGR from 45.1 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 83.9 GWh, with a notable 6.7 percent growth in 2016 alone mainly due to increased supply with the commissioning of four 2.5 MW diesel generators. Generated electricity includes purchase of 1.1 GWh from Solomon Tropical Products company which sells excess electricity to SIEA under a loosely negotiated power purchase agreement (PPA). Total electricity generated in the provincial grids in 2016 was 6.7 GWh.\n3.     The high retail tariff has been due to the expensive diesel generation cost and the application of the 2005 Tariff Regulation.  SIEA’s system was 100 percent reliant on diesel generation until 1 MW grid-connected solar farm was commissioned in June 2016. As seen in Table A1-1, retail tariffs increased during years of high global oil prices between 2011 and 2014. However, it should be noted that the retail tariff was still increasing in 2014 when oil prices had already started to reduce. Also, while oil prices more than halved in 2015 compared to 2014, the retail tariff reduced only marginally.\n                                    Table A1-1: SIEA Average Retail Tariff (2011-2016)\n                     Customers                  2011      2012     2013    2014      2015    2016\n                     Domestic                 5.2477    5.9553   6.0816  6.4341    6.2365  5.8667\n                     Commercial               5.6569    6.3977   6.3695  6.7374    6.5539  6.1870\n                     Industrial               5.5039    6.2323   6.5413  6.9186    6.7434  6.3783\n                     Weighted Average         5.4467    6.1705   6.4031  6.7729    6.5910  6.2244\n                     Avg Tariff in US$/KwHr     0.72      0.87     0.90    0.93      0.84    0.80\n                  Source: Bank analysis based on SIEA data, 2017\n4.

"content": "high oil prices, the benefit of the lower fuel cost in later years was not fully translated into lower retail tariff levels.\n5.     SIEA conducted a cost-of-service and tariff review and introduced the new tariff methodology, Tariff Regulation of 2016, in January 2017 to appropriately reflect the fuel price in the tariff. With its introduction, the base tariff was reset resulting in a reduction in the average retail tariff from US$ 80 cents/kWh in 2016 to US$ 65 cents/KWh for the first two months of 2017. Despite the reduction, the retail tariff is still significantly higher than the Pacific regional average of residential retail tariff of approximately US$ 40 cents/kWh. To further lower its retail tariff to levels at par with the other Pacific countries, SIEA plans to expand its customer base, enhance efficiency and significantly expand the use of less expensive, indigenous renewable energy sources.\n6.     SIEA has had a strong financial position since 2011. SIEA was in financial crisis and close to insolvency with severe cash-flow problems until 2010 as a result of the “tension” and poor utility management. However, owing to the strong intervention of the Solomon Islands Government (SIG), a tariff calculation methodology that adjusted the tariff up along with the increase of fuel, but did not adequately pass through reductions in fuel price to the retail tariff (i.e. SIEA’s customers), and support provided through the World Bank-financed SISEP project, SIEA’s financial performance improved dramatically from making losses until 2010 to a net profit of SBD68 million in 2012, and increasing since to SBD107 million in 2015. Electricity sales revenues increased from SBD351.5 million in 2011 to SBD433.5 million in 2016. Accounts receivable also improved from 70 days of sales in 2011 to 40 days in 2015. The system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) improved from 51,840 minutes/customer/year in 2007 to 2,604 minutes/customer/year in 2015, and the system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) also improved from 816 times/customer/year to 38 times/customer/year during the same period.\n7.     In addition to investments in lower cost, renewable generation capacity, there are other steps that can be taken to continue to drive down the retail electricity tariff. SIEA is targeting further improvements in efficiency such as setting an aggressive target to reduce losses from 21 percent in 2016 to 11 percent in 2021. Table A1-2 summarizes SIEA’s average system loss from 2011 to 2016. SIEA also aims to reduce input costs, overheads, depreciation, and financing costs. Appropriate re-basing of the non-fuel tariff component of the 2016 Tariff Regulation due in October 2020 will likely allow the retail tariff to be further reduced.\n                                Table A1-2: SIEA System Loss in Honiara (2011-2016)\n                                                 2011       2012      2013       2014       2015      2016\n Energy Generation in Honiara     GWh            74.7       75.3       73.0      77.4       78.7      83.9\n Own Use in Honiara               GWh             2.9        2.7        3.2        2.7       2.6       3.1\n Loss in Honiara                  GWh            15.8       16.1       14.0      15.3       16.0      17.5\n Energy Sold in Honiara           GWh            56.0       56.5       56.0      59.4       60.1      63.3\n Loss                             %             21.1%      21.4%     18.9%      19.7%      20.4%     20.9%\n8.

Further sensitivity analysis using 4 percent discount rate resulted in optimal commissioning of TRHDP\nbeing in 2027; and reduction in hydrology by 10 percent using the same discount rate would push back TRHDP\nto 2028.\n12.    The counterfactual “without TRHDP” scenario (Figure A1-3) formulated by the Bank’s analysis showed\nthat the share of renewable energy is higher in the “with TRHDP” scenario. Solar generation (partly supported\nby the use of battery storage) would be expected to meet 58 percent of the total demand by 2046 under the\n“without TRHDP” scenario which is higher than 40 percent under the “with TRHDP” scenario. However, the\ntotal renewable energy percentage “with TRHDP” in 2046 is 83 percent since TRHDP will generate additional 43\npercent on top of the solar share. As such, the percentage of renewable energy in the system would be 25\npercentage points higher with TRHDP than without. Therefore, in terms of climate change mitigation impact,\ndiesel generation in 2046 remains high at 42 percent under the “without TRHDP” scenario, while diesel only\ngenerates 16 percent under the “with TRHDP” scenario. This analysis show that TRHDP provides an opportunity\nfor the grid to simultaneously increase the share of renewable energy in HES and at least-cost.\n       20 The least-cost dispatch optimized rules for, and implicitly simulated, a lag-one Markov stochastic inflow model,\nbased on the synthetic data generated in the Feasibility Study, and captures variability of hydropower generation.\n                                                                                                         Page 52 of 97",

"content": "The Feasibility Study Phase 3 had estimated the cost of the entire Project (developed for 20 MW but without the cost of the fourth 5 MW unit) including the access road and the transmission line to be US$134.41 million in 2014. During the course of the negotiation with K-water, the access road and transmission line were removed from the EPC package and the initially envisaged micro-hydro facility at the environmental flow outlet has been removed from the design. For this scope, the Feasibility Study Phase 3 cost estimate would be US$124.5 million, while K-water’s price proposal of August 2016 was US$140.00 million (excluding taxes).\n\nIt is important to note that the project cost estimated in the Feasibility Study, at a unit cost of US$8.62 million/MW for the 15 MW scheme, is expensive by international standards. Since the scheme is actually developed to accommodate an additional 5 MW unit for a total installed capacity of 20 MW, the unit cost can be calculated as US$6.58 million/MW including the incremental cost to install the fourth unit. However, this is still expensive compared to an attractive hydropower project in other parts of the world which would be around US$2-3 million/MW.\n\nThe reason for the high development cost can be explained partially by (i) the high cost environment of the Solomon Islands, and (ii) by the high cost of developing a hydropower plant in a challenging natural condition. With regards the former constraint, given the remoteness of the Solomon Islands and the need to import almost every equipment and materials, the unit cost of every item in the bill of quantities is much more expensive than in other parts of the world. A simple calculation using unit costs of a recent project in Indonesia has demonstrated that the Project would be about 30 percent less expensive if it were to use those rates. The second constraint is related to the site in which the Project is being developed including limited availability and high seasonal variation of hydrological resources, unavailability of favorable topography with natural head, complex geological conditions and active seismic activities.\n\nThe final costs of Component 1, subject to finalization and signature of the PPA, are provided below in Table A1-4.",

On the appointment of the Project Accountant and Project Manager a meeting with the appropriate MMERE staff will be held to outline and document the specific authorizing officers and processes. This will include documenting; cheque signatories, who can authorize purchase orders, payment vouchers etc; what are the arrangements when authorizing personnel are unavailable; and ensuring evidence of adequate technical review of the major civil works deliverables prior to payment. Authorized signatories for Withdrawal Applications will be staff designated to that effect by the Minister of Finance and Treasury although the preparation of Withdrawal Applications will be done by project staff. The World Bank staff will provide a training session to the Project Manager and Project Accountant covering the specific World Bank requirements outlined in the Legal Agreements and Disbursement Letter. For Components 1 and 2 the internal control framework of the PC will focus on ensuring that the project equity funding is used for the purposes intended. It is expected that the PC, when established, will have a framework for their processes and procedures and these will be reviewed as part of the subsequent FM assessment of the PC. In addition, an adequate governance structure needs to be in place to ensure that the equity funding is not diluted or misused. For component 3 the payment process will be subject to the same controls as for component 4, and procuring of the contracts, contract management and subsequent payments will be managed by the SIEA and reported in the consolidated IFRs and project audit. SIEA has previous experience working on World Bank projects and have a staff procedures manual outlining their internal controls. There has been strong compliance to the procedures manual.",

GCF funds would be channeled through the Bank²¹, with the Bank disbursing to the PC on GCF’s behalf as well as making payments directly to construction and supervision firms. DFAT funds would be managed by the Bank in a trust account and either channeled directly to the construction and supervision firms through direct payments or to a Designated Account set up by MMERE for project payments. The sequencing of financing from IDA and other financiers, and across grant and loan/credit financing sources, will be finalized as a part of the process of securing financing from all co-financing sources. There will likely be pro-rata disbursements by sources contributing to each component and a preference for disbursing grants ahead of loans and disbursing the most expensive loans last to reduce financing costs. In the case where IDA co-finances with other financiers under a component (or components) of the Project, IDA may finance expenditures under such component(s) up to 100%, inclusive of taxes, if other financier’s funds is not yet available. Pro-rata disbursement arrangements may be employed once other financier’s funds become available. Co-financiers are not expected to place any restrictions on sequencing, so SIG will draw on available sources in the most cost effective and practical manner.",

Component 1 of the project will satisfy all of the “Scope of Application” requirements in Clauses 3 – 6 of OP 4.03. Limitations identified in Clause 7 of OP 4.03 would not apply. Accordingly, the World Bank PS will apply to Component 1 irrespective of whether IFC is involved in financing the private entity as use of OP4.03 is linked to the private entity, not IFC. For Component 1, the developer will be responsible for addressing seven of the eight World Bank Performance Standards, beginning with PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts. The Bank’s PS 5: Involuntary Resettlement does not apply to Component 1 as land acquisition activities are being undertaken by the Government, and not the developer.\nThe Government has completed and disclosed a Draft ESIA as part of the Feasibility Study and tendering process to attract a private developer. K-water, as the main project sponsor, will submit its own full ESIA and updated Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) to SIG in order to receive Development Consent from the Director of Environment in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and Meteorology (MECDM). Subsequent Contractors Environmental and Social Management Plans (CESMPs) will be prepared and approved during project delivery. The Bank has reviewed the ESIA and K-water’s ESMS and prepared a draft Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) as required by the World Bank Performance Standards (PS).\nEnvironmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01. For Component 3, OP 4.01 is triggered as the transmission line construction by SIEA is likely to result in environmental and social impacts. The potential impacts and their mitigation are covered in the ESIA for Components 1 and 2, since the access road and transmission line are associated projects of the dam and power plant construction.\nNatural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04). The policy is triggered for Components 2 and 3. Natural habitat is addressed under PS6 for Component 1. In preparation of the ESIA, fauna, flora and fish surveys have been carried out and project affected communities have been extensively consulted through social surveys and mitigation workshops. The main impact during operations would be on aquatic ecology, related to the presence of the dam, an impassable obstacle to all fish due to its height. The ESMP proposes mitigation measures including environmental flow (riparian flow), a “trap and haul” system to allow migratory fish to pass the dam, protective devices for fish mortality in turbines, and fish monitoring, to allow major impacts to be mitigated to moderate significance.\nThe undisturbed montane forests in the upper catchment (located well above the furthest extent of the reservoir) meet the definition of natural habitat. The project is not expected to have direct impacts on those forests. The project’s access road approaches the site from the downstream side of the dam and is located well away (4-10km) from the montane forest areas. The project does not anticipate an increase in the accessibility of the forest. None of the upper catchment is presently in a protected status although it possesses the potential to become a protected area. However, several vulnerable species were observed during inventories of the area. An NGO will also be engaged to work with landowning tribes in the upper catchment to support the first stages of establishing a protected area, up to the point of preparing a.",

For\nthe purposes of the social impact assessment and social safeguards compliance, the vast majority of groups\nresident in the project area can be considered indigenous Solomon Islanders.\n42.       For Component 1, the developer will be responsible for addressing PS 7: Indigenous Peoples.\nUnder Component 3, SIEA will have the corresponding responsibility under OP 4.10. OP 4.10 also applies to\nComponent 1, specifically to the land acquisition and resulting impacts on livelihoods. A separate\nIndigenous Peoples Plan is not being prepared in keeping with the provision of OP 4.10 that IPP\nrequirements can be integrated into the overall project design when the overwhelming majority of direct\nproject beneficiaries are indigenous people. However, a Community Development Plan (CDP) has been\nprepared to clearly specify the social and economic benefits to be received by the communities in the\nproject area, all of which are indigenous. The CDP specifies the benefits which will be provided to the five\ncore landowning tribes as per the provisions of the signed Process Agreement, in particular, a 1.5% royalty\non part of annual PPA payments. Land lease will be used for the benefits of the cooperative societies of the\nfive core landowning tribes. The benefits to be provided to the Bahomea and Malango cultural community\nare also described in the CDP, and separated into a mechanism and financing for benefit sharing during\nconstruction and during the 30-year PPA period of HPF operations.\n43.       Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12. The project will not cause any physical displacement\nrequiring relocation. Based on the technical design in the final feasibility study, the minimum area required\nfor the hydroelectric plant and auxiliary facilities, some sections of the transmission lines, and during\nconstruction, for Lot 2 and sections of Lot 1 of the access roads, quarries, and disposal sites has been\nidentified and referred to as the “core land area.” The core land area covers 428 ha. This land is\nuninhabited, and it is utilized by customary landowners primarily for hunting, non-timber forest products\nand, potentially, the sale of timber. The tribal registries for the five tribes identified as landowners identify\n781 individual people as affected by the land process agreement of the core land.\n44.       Using   traditional methods   of inquiry  and  storytelling the Bahomea    Land  Identification\nCommittee (BLIC) completed a process of documenting the Land Ownership of core land blocks and tested\nthe outcomes with the tribal leaders of the Bahomea House of Chiefs. SIG subsequently shared the results\nwith the wider group comprising 27 tribes, including those in the Malango House of Chiefs, even though\nthe core land required for the project does not include Malango territory. This resulted in endorsement of\nthe outcomes recorded. The BLIC was self-initiated and conducted by its members, independently of SIG.\nThis process has facilitated land identification by indigenous groups in the core land area. Through the\nsigning of the Process Agreement with the four identified tribes (Kochiabolo, Roha, Buhu Garo and\nVuralingi) in August 2014, and subsequent addition of a fifth signatory tribe (Uluna-Sutahuri) through the\nstatutory process of land acquisition, they confirmed their agreement for the Government to acquire the\nland for the purposes of the project under a comprehensive agreement as to its use and benefits provided\nto the landowning tribes.\n45.       Subsequent to signing the Process Agreement, the government has completed the statutory\nprocedures under Division 2 of the Land and Titles Act, including the appeals period. The Commissioner\nmade offers to all five land-owning tribes. None of the tribes appealed to the offer. According to the Land\nand Titles Act, the absence of appeals confirms the offer to be final (i.e. it is not contested). SIG has placed",

For Component 1,    PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary     Resettlement   is not triggered because the developer will not have any responsibilities that fall beyond government’s responsibility via its acquisition of land. OP 4.12 will be triggered for Component 1 as the land process agreement is mainly the responsibility of the SIG. OP 4.12 is also triggered for Components 2 and 3 as the final road alignment and transmission line route have not been fixed and could entail the acquisition of additional land. Terms of Reference for consultants advising on topics related to OP 4.12 will be approved by the Bank to ensure the requirements of the World Bank are effectively integrated into the TA work under Component 4. The Land Acquisition and Livelihood Restoration Plan (LALRP) was disclosed on the Bank’s external website on August 15, 2016.\n47.        Since the Performance Standards apply to Component 1, the developer will be responsible for addressing dam safety under PS 4: Community Health, Safety and Security. OP 4.37: Safety of Dams will also be triggered to include SIG’s responsibility with respect to dam safety.    Terms of Reference for consultants advising on topics related to this PS will be approved by the Bank to ensure the requirements of the Performance Standards are effectively integrated into the TA work under Component 4. As part of project preparation, in July 2013, the Project Office contracted three international experts, whose selection process has been approved by the Bank, as members of the Dam Safety Advisory Panel, basing the Panel’s terms of reference on World Bank OP/BP 4.37. The members of the Panel will continue to provide ongoing advice on technical aspects of the project during implementation.\n48.        The project will have the potential to create a number of negative social impacts beyond those addressed by specific operational policies. These include direct physical impacts on nearby communities (e.g., intrusive noise, vibration, explosion shockwaves, dust, air and ground discharges, and visual intrusion) some of which could have potential health consequences and negative impacts on way of life and local amenities; loss of access to abundant clean fresh water; damage to and/or loss of access to livelihoods assets, including fishing areas, food garden areas, hunting areas, plant and related materials, planted and wild fruit and nut trees, and timber woodlots and plantations, with potential negative impacts on household and community wellbeing.\n49.        The ESIA and ESMP assess and set management criteria, including a requirement for the EPC contractor to prepare and implement an Influx Management Plan, associated with construction workers, with a particular aim of protecting the health and well-being of women and children. The project developer and construction contractors will also be expected, in advance of any construction work commencing on the project, to prepare and promulgate a code of conduct for its workers (and related visitors), including locals, other Solomon Islanders, and immigrants/expats. Importantly, the site is located close to Honiara (approximately 30 minutes from the airport and an hour from the center of the city). Furthermore, given the level of skills in the local area as a result of a previously operating gold mine in an adjacent valley, the project developer will be required to source workers as much as possible from the local area. This existing skill level is proposed to be supplemented by skills and vocational training under the community benefit sharing program. This will greatly reduce the social threats arising from inappropriate behavior of outside construction workers, and local people employed on the Project.",

The PC will be required to give preference to members of the Bahomea and Malango cultural community over a resident of another area of Solomon Islands; and Solomon Islander over an expatriate. Notwithstanding this, the project developer will be required to ensure that specific measures are developed to ensure workers from outside Tina area are accommodated outside the project area, that no worker camps be located in the project area and that accommodation be planned well in advance to cope with seasonal increase in Honiara population.",

"content": "Joint Government-Landowner Company and Landowner Royalties. The Process Agreement signed by the five core landowning tribes included benefits above and beyond fair compensation for the land acquired. The main provisions are the establishment of a Tina Core Land Company (TCLC) which will be jointly owned by Government and the five landowning tribes, and the establishment of Tribal Cooperatives which will be the recipients of land compensation funds as well as a 1.5 percent royalty on part of annual PPA payments. The Cooperatives will distribute funds equally to all members of the tribe, regardless of age or gender. The TCLC will be responsible for making decisions on the use of the core land which are consistent with the effective operation of the HPF. The TCLC will receive land lease payments which will largely go to administering the Company, but which will also direct any additional funds to the members of the tribal cooperatives. The Tribal Cooperatives for the three tribes that have accepted land compensation have been established and are operational. The TCLC has yet to be established. SIG aims to register the TCLC by the time the EPC contract is signed so that land lease payments can begin prior to construction. Establishing the administrative arrangements for the TCLC will take some time as it is a new entity.",

Beyond the compensation being provided by the Government for land claims, and the benefits provided for in the Process Agreement, communities in the broader project area, including downstream, will receive community development benefits from a benefit sharing scheme which Government is developing in consultation with the project area communities. The scheme will not be fully implemented until the HPF begins to operate as the financing of the scheme will be directly linked to the financial flows of the PC. In the meantime, Government has agreed to seek JSDF financing to (i) establish the implementation arrangement; (ii) build the capacity of the communities to identify, implement and operate the community projects; and (iii) to implement early investment projects (i.e. water supply) in advance of the launch of the scheme. The benefit sharing scheme will be designed to be delivered in a highly consultative, community driven manner, with a focus on improving the well-being of community members, in particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals, including female-headed households and the disabled.",

A Gender Action Plan (GAP) has been completed as part of the Project to guide the mainstreaming of gender into the TRHDP with a particular focus on promoting equal opportunities for women and men to participate in project benefits. While the Tina River Project will have national impact through the provision of more reliable and affordable electricity, the GAP is principally concerned with the impact of the project on the lives of communities within its immediate footprint area. The GAP was prepared based primarily on interviews with project-affected women and men, with project office staff, and with government and other key stakeholders conducted during fieldwork in the Solomon Islands between November 14ᵗʰ and 26ᵗʰ 2015. The Plan is organized around four strategic objective areas: (a) reducing the burden of work on women and improving their livelihood opportunities through access to resources and services; (b) ensuring gender equality in opportunities for education, skill building, training.",

"section": "Monitoring and Evaluation",
"content": "The PO will be primarily responsible for gathering data and reporting on progress towards the achievement of project results indicators via quarterly project reports. Staff identified by SIEA and the PC will contribute data as needed. Most of the results indicators are tied to the completion of major milestones in the project, namely the completion of access road and transmission line construction and the commissioning of the HPF and the benefits which emanate from them (e.g. reduced GHG emissions and renewable energy generation). Drawing upon technical specialists when needed, in particular the Independent Engineer that will be contracted to monitor construction of the HPF and the Dam Safety Advisory Panel, the PO will verify satisfactory completion of each milestone. The PC, as part of its responsibilities within the IA and the PA with IDA, to receive financing, will submit reports on key milestones to MMERE and MOFT. SIEA will also contribute to MMERE reporting with respect to transmission line construction progress and key indicators reflecting the system costs of electricity generation and the percentage of electricity generated by renewable sources.\n\nThe PO will monitor the implementation of social and environmental mitigation actions, impacts and beneficiary feedback through regular community meetings, a baseline, mid-term and end-line household survey, as well as a grievance redress mechanism which will systematically monitor feedback from various stakeholders and ensure that appropriate responses to such feedback are provided. Inputs will be provided by the Independent Environmental and Social Monitoring Agent that will be engaged by MMERE. The PC will have environmental, social, and health and safety specialists continuously on site. The project will also provide support to MECDM to ensure that it has adequate capacity to monitor the environmental performance of the project and enforce compliance with the conditions of the Development Consent.\n\nTable A2-5 summarizes the key responsibilities and applicable policies on safeguards and procurement of the implementing entities.",

"section": "ANNEX 3: IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PLAN",
"content": "COUNTRY: Solomon Islands\nTina River Hydropower Development Project\nStrategy and Approach for Implementation Support\n1. The strategy for implementation support has been developed based on the nature of the Project and its risk profile. Risks considered to be notable include: (a) difficult terrain to construct access roads could lead to delays that could put pressure on the project timeline; (b) weak government capacity to participate effectively as a PC shareholder through ICSI; (c) extensive social and environmental safeguard data to be gathered and actions to be taken as part of Management Plans and limited Government capacity to effectively monitor compliance; (d) local and global civil society and public interest in the project with limited Government capacity to respond; (e) high technical complexity of HPF construction and need to carefully monitor and ensure public safety and contract compliance; and (f) influx of local and foreign workers in project area raises the risk of inappropriate or illegal behavior. The proposed mitigation measures to contain these risks are integrated into various Project design features. Specifically, the strategic approach for implementation support includes the following measures: (a) Difficult terrain to construct access roads could lead to delays and/or cost escalation that could put financial pressure the project timeline. The road design and contracting process has revealed the challenging nature of the terrain and the risk that this could lead to the need for greater quantities of material, time and labor to address circumstances that are more difficult than anticipated. While the access road construction is to be delivered as a fixed price contract, there is a risk that if the contractor significantly exceeds budget due to local conditions, and asks the Off-taker to approve time extensions or even cost variations. To assist the Off-taker and Government to manage this risk and to better understand the progress and challenges being faced by the construction firm and solutions that are being employed, a road transport specialist will travel for site visits and review reports and data. (b) Weak government capacity to participate effectively as a PC shareholder through ICSI. ICSI currently has a small number of holdings, none of which require the channeling of equity returns to MOFT for repayment of loans, as would be the case with this project. All returns to ICSI are used to finance its ongoing operations. Therefore, there will be an arrangement between MOFT and ICSI to ensure that the equity returns paid to ICSI by the PC are effectively transferred to MOFT. While funds will not flow from IDA through ICSI to the PC, but rather directly to the PC on behalf of ICSI, a PPP Specialist or other specialist with experience in the management of state-owned investment companies will provide support to ICSI to enhance their capacity.

"content": "COUNTRY: Solomon Islands\nTina River Hydropower Development Project\nSOLOMON ISLANDS TINA RIVER HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nSUMMARY OF INDICATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF IDA FINANCING\nPurpose: This term sheet contains a summary of indicative main terms and conditions of a proposed\nfinancing (“IDA Financing”) from the International Development Association (“IDA”) and is provided for\ndiscussion purposes only. It does not reflect the provisions of the IDA General Conditions for Credits and\nGrants which apply indistinctively to all IDA Financing (available on www.worldbank.org, subject to\nchange). The terms and conditions of a proposed IDA financing will be determined once all project\nstakeholders have reached a final agreement on the Project implementation and financing arrangement\nand IDA is better able to assess the residual risks to be mitigated through legal covenants and conditions.\nThis term sheet does not constitute an offer to provide the IDA Financing.  The provision of the IDA\nFinancing is subject, inter alia, to satisfactory appraisal of the Project by IDA, compliance with all policies\napplicable to the IDA Financing, including those related to environmental and social safeguards, review\nand acceptance of the ownership, management, financing structure, and transaction documentation by\nIDA, and the approval of the management and Executive Directors of IDA in their sole discretion. In\naddition, Board approval constitutes an authorization to extend financing on the terms and conditions\napproved by the Board, but only if the financing agreement for such purpose is signed and declared\neffective no later than 18 months after the date of such Board approval.\nBackground: The Solomon Islands (Recipient) wishes to undertake the Tina River Hydropower Project\n(“Project”), comprising the development, financing, construction and operation of a hydropower\ngeneration plant (Component 1), the design and construction of access roads through upgrade of an\nexisting segment (Lot 1) and construction of a new segment (Lot 2) (Component 2), construction of\ntransmission lines to the grid (Component 3) and provision of TA for Project Coordination and\nimplementation of environmental and social safeguard related activities (Component 4).      A Project\nCompany will be established between the Recipient (acting though its holding company),       the EPC\nContractor and the O&M Contractor for the implementation of Component 1 of the Project (on a build,\nown, operate and transfer basis) and Component 2 of the Project. The Project Company will enter into a\nLease Agreement with a land owning company with respect to the land on which Component 1 and\nComponent 2 Lot 2 will be implemented, an EPC Contract with the EPC Contractor for the engineering,\nprocurement and construction of the hydropower generation plant and construction/upgrade of the\naccess road, and an O&M Contract with the O&M Contractor for the operation and maintenance of the\nplant and Lot 2 of Component 2, and a Power Purchase Agreement with the Offtaker pursuant to which\nthe Offtaker will commit to purchase the capacity and the electricity produced by the plant. Component 1\nis expected to be financed through the Project Company’s equity as well as concessional financing to be\nprovided by the Recipient to the Project Company. Component 2 is expected to be financed by a grant\nfrom the Recipient to the Project Company. Component 3 is expected to be implemented by Solomon\nIslands Electricity Authority (SIEA), and financed in part from a concessional financing from the Recipient\nto SIEA. Component 4 is expected to be implemented by the Recipient.",
