"content": "1.0   Purpose\n  The purpose of this grant activity is to contribute towards improved functionality rate of water\n  supply facilities, increased access to water and increased access to sanitation in underserved areas\n  of Zambia.\n1.1   Project Description\n  RTI International (RTII) was awarded the USAID Expanding Water and Sanitation Project in January\n  2022. The purpose of the USAID Expanding Water and Sanitation Project (USAID Expanding\n  WASH) is to professionalize WASH services, to promote accountability for reliable and high-quality\n  WASH services, and to enhance the enabling environment for private sector engagement (PSE) in\n  service delivery in underserved areas of Zambia (Northern, Western and Muchinga provinces). The\n  period of award is five-years.\n  The overall objective of USAID Expanding WASH project is to maintain and expand sustainable\n  WASH services in peri-urban, rural growth centers, and rural areas of Muchinga, Northern,\n  Western and Southern Provinces in 12 selected districts namely Chinsali, Nakonde, Mpika, Lunte,\n  Mungwi, Kazungula, Kalomo, Nalolo, Kalabo, Mongu, Kaoma and Sesheke. Over the course of a five-\n  year period, the project targets to increase access to water by 15% and increase access to sanitation\n  by 25%.\n  The three objectives for the project are:\n  Objective 1: Institutionalize market-based WASH service delivery, with financially sustainable and\n  inclusive management models.\n  Objective 2:   Increase the accountability of WASH service providers, policymakers, and civic\n  leaders.\n  Objective 3: Increase private sector participation (PSP).\n  1.2 Grants Activity\n  The general poor state of WASH infrastructure is a significant contributor to the low availability of\n  water in the rural areas, whereas effective infrastructure O&M management is critical to ensuring\n  sustainable and functional WASH systems. The project recognizes the strategic role played by\n  District Water Sanitation and Hygiene (D-WASHE) and Village Water Sanitation and Hygiene (V-\n  WASHE) committees in identification of sites for rehabilitation, coordination of infrastructure\n  upgrade,  identification of Area  Pump   Menders   (APMs)  and  facilitation and development   of\n  appropriate enabling environment and entry point private sector engagement. This grant activity\n  seeks to build capacity of District Water Sanitation and Hygiene (D-WASHE) and Village Water\n  Sanitation and Hygiene (V-WASHE) committees, Area Pump menders (APMs) and Community\n  Champions (CCs), with an objective to increase functionality rate of water supply facilities, increase\n  access to water and increase access to sanitation.\n  The project seeks to work with eligible Enterprise or, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs),\n  excluding GRZ institutions, who will undertake specific capacity building activities as described\n  below.\n      A. Under objective 1, Task 1.2.4- Orient and build capacity in D-WASHE committees, V-\n         WASHE committees and Area Pump Menders (APMs) in the Operation, Maintenance and\n         Management of water points.",

Under objective 1, Task 1.3.3- Build capacity in Community champions (CCs) to implement sanitation behavioral change activities that will address open defecation and improve access to basic sanitation in the target populations.\nC.  Support Equipment - Distribute support equipment (Bicycles, Toolkits and Smart Phones) to APMs, CCs and Environmental Health Technicians (EHTs).\nGrant recipients will implement the above activities in the 5 selected districts of Northern and Muchinga province that USAID Expanding WASH project is working in.\nIn developing their budgets, applicants should include relevant costs relating to Activity A, B and C above. However, note that under Activity C – Support Equipment (Bicycles, Toolkits and Smart Phones), these will be procured directly by USAID Expanding WASH Project and will be provided as an in-kind grant for distribution by the Grantee. Therefore, for Activity C, applicants should include in their budgets only the costs related to distribution.\nThe proposed grant activities must be within the framework of the following sub-objectives and tasks and conform to overall USAID Expanding WASH objectives.\nSub-Objective 1.2: Enhance Construction Quality of Small-Scale Water Systems (New and Rehabilitated Hand Pump Boreholes and Small Piped-water Schemes)\nTask 1.2.4 - Orient and build capacity in D-WASHE committees, V-WASHE committees and Area Pump Menders in the Operation, Maintenance and Management of water points.\nActivities:\n    •   Orient the D-WASHE committees and V-WASHE committees in sustainable Operation, Maintenance and Management of selected water points. In addition, developing enabling environment for private sector participation.\n    •   Conduct needs assessment and undertake practical training APMs on repair of non-functional boreholes with hand pumps.\n    •   Equipping APMs: As part of this activity, new water point tool kits for the repair of water points will be procured by the project, as an in-kind grant to the Grantee, and will be distributed by the Grantee under an improved tool kit management system at district and subdistrict level. The target is to train 120 APMs and procure and distribute 30 special & standard tool kits covering all the 5 districts.\nSub-Objective 1.3: Facilitate Access for the Poor to Adequate Sanitation Facilities\nTask 1.3.3 – Train CCs to be selected from the 5 target districts on ways to address open defecation and improve access to basic sanitation in the target populations with a market-based approach that supports supply chain development in the construction of toilets.\nActivities:\n    •   Building of capacity in 90 CC covering all the 5 selected districts. The training will enable CCs to mobilize communities and effectively disseminate sanitation behavioral change messages in villages.\n    •   Equipping the CCs: Distribute 90 Bicycles to be procured by the project and awarded to the grantee as an in-kind grant.\n    •   Monitoring and Reporting: Distribute 35 Smartphones procured by the project and awarded to the grantee, as an in-kind grant, for EHTs to monitor activities and report progress on water and sanitation activities.",
