"section": "Context and Rationale",
"content": "Government is due to publish a new England Tree Strategy later this year (2020). It focuses on expanding, protecting and improving woodlands so that trees and woodlands can connect more people to nature, support the economy, combat climate change and recover biodiversity. The draft strategy sets out policy priorities to deliver an ambitious national tree planting programme.\nThe Forestry Commission is the government department responsible for protecting, expanding and promoting the sustainable management of woodlands and it has a target to increase UK woodland from 13% of all land cover to 19% by 2050.\nCity of York Council has set a goal to plant 50,000 trees by 2023 to support the national effort and to help achieve York’s wider ambition to be net carbon neutral by 2030.  Tree canopy cover in York is 10.8% against a national (England) average of 10%.¹\nThe city is signatory to the Northern Forest initiative that aims to plant 50 million trees across northern England. Woodland cover in northern England is currently just 7.6% of all land cover, well below the UK (13%) and England averages.\nIt is also a member of the White Rose Forest partnership, a joint venture involving councils and environmental bodies working to support woodland creation across the Leeds City Region and York.\nThe project makes the following strategic links:\n       Work currently underway by York and North Yorkshire LEP to define a carbon abatement pathway. Planting of woodland is considered an important carbon negative intervention in any pathway with a need to significantly increase the amount of woodland across York and North Yorkshire.\n       Planning positively for the creation, protection, enhancement and management of York’s green infrastructure is a key part of the city’s emerging new Local Plan.\n       Helping deliver York’s strategic health priorities. There is significant evidence demonstrating the positive public health benefits of green space including help with physical and mental health, obesity, dementia and autism.\n       Creating opportunities for people to walk and cycle in woodland helps drive progress towards more active travel and healthier lifestyles – a central feature of the city’s Transport Plan.\n1 Woodland Trust",

"section": "Aim & Objectives",
"content": "Aim\nThe aim of this project is to create a large new area of woodland within close proximity to the city in order to provide green amenity space for residents and visitors, and to aid the council’s commitment to planting 50,000 trees by 2023. This goal comes as part of the council’s wider ambition to become net carbon neutral by 2030, and supports the emerging blue & green infrastructure strategy and pollinator strategy. Users of this woodland, and the wider community surrounding it, will benefit from this project as it provides them with a space to socialise, exercise and be educated about nature and biodiversity. Executive (27 August 2020) approved a draft high level vision for the project to be consulted on as part of the early community and stakeholder engagement work: “The new woodland will be a well-designed, biodiverse green space providing a place for peaceful contemplation and leisure for the people of York. It will create a new Stray for the city, enhance the setting of the city and make York an even greater place to live work and visit.”\nObjectives\n      Increase amenity green space by 194 acres / 78 hectares, providing new outdoor leisure opportunities, areas for physical activity, walking and cycling, new educational opportunities and linking up York’s green corridors\n      Plant a minimum of 50,000 trees that will sequester CO2 to support net-zero, improve local air quality and reduce flood risk.\n      Create new commercial activity that will fund management/maintenance of the forest and provide new employment, volunteering and green skills development opportunities\n      Leverage other public and private sector investment to expand tree planting within the city.",

"section": "Project Scope",
"content": "The site for the new woodland currently comprises 190+ acres of arable farmland to the west of the city between the villages of Knapton and Rufforth and fully within the York local authority boundary. Discussions are ongoing regarding other parcels of land adjacent to or close by the site that offer scope to plant more trees and simplify access and layout of the woodland.\nThe current site is deemed large enough to achieve the council’s tree planning target of 50,000 tress and create amenity green space in the west of the city that meets the requirements of the draft Local Plan.\nThe location is close to the urban footprint of York and to existing sustainable transport links.\nThe council’s Executive (13 February 2020) agreed a £3 million budget to purchase pieces of land over a period of 5 years to plant trees. There are multiple sources of potential external funding including the government’s Nature for Climate programme, Countryside Stewardship and Woodland Carbon Fund. Further work is required to establish the levels of grant available to ensure the financial impact to the council can be mitigated as much as possible.\nA broad range of council services are within scope of the project including officers working on climate reduction, property and assets, health and wellbeing, sustainable transport, public rights of way, countryside and ecology, policy and city partnerships, communications, learning and skills, ward committees and democratic services.",

"section": "Approach",
"content": "Project delivery will be through a partnership approach facilitated by City of York Council.\nMembership of the White Rose Forest partnership provides access to a range of expertise throughout the various stages of the woodland design process, including how to design an amenity woodland, the species of trees to be planted and sustainable long term management. It also provides a link into funding opportunities available throughout the WRF Delivery Pathway and assistance in making funding bids.\nA stakeholder advisory group made up of informed local residents, charitable trusts and other professionals will be established to inform development and management proposals that meet Forestry Commission regulatory requirements and these will be brought before the council’s Executive for agreement.\nOngoing community and stakeholder engagement will ensure local residents, community and charitable groups have an opportunity to shape woodland design.",
