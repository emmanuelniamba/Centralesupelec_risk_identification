CAB staff had\npreviously been organized into groups of either telecommunications or energy response\nhandling; however, each CAB representative is now handling Energy,\nTelecommunications, and Water inquiries and complaints.\nAdditionally, there are personnel throughout the CPUC who are tasked with\ninvestigating, analyzing, and monitoring utility compliance, performance, and activities.",

The hardware will be sited at the Department of Technology Services while CPUC staff will maintain the application software.\n\nServices associated with complete deployment of the solution implemented by this project include:\n−  Generation of the Request for Proposal (RFP)\n−  Procurement of a technology solution that best meets the requirements housed within the RFP.\n−  Provision of the technology solution by an integrator, who is selected following the evaluation of responses to the RFP.\n−  Independent validation and verification of project artifacts and activities.\n−  Management of the project processes in accordance with best practices as outlined within the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) published by the PMI and the State DOF Information Technology Oversight Framework\n−  Information Technology Project Oversight assessment and completion of Department of Finance (DOF) required Independent Project Oversight Reports\n\nThe Request for Proposal (RFP) will be the vehicle for selection and procurement of a technology solution that will be:\n−  Capable of responding to recurrent and customized queries, both to determine the sources of complaints and the need for education and enforcement;\n−  A resource for CAB Representatives by providing concurrent online access to rules, statutes, policies, and similar informal complaints, increasing responsiveness to consumers;",

These initiatives include:\nISB Data Center Analysis & Information Technology Strategic Plan (Sponsored\nby Paul Clanon and Karen Davis; document delivered 8/28/2006 by TechProse)\nThe Process Enhancement Project (“PEP”) – resulting in a report titled\n“SOLUTIONS FOR CHANGE - Process Improvement Recommendations to the\nConsumer Affairs Branch”, published in July of 2006.\nWhile it is important to note that the goals and objectives of these projects are NOT\nwithin the scope of the CIMS project, it is also acknowledged there may be some points\nof impact between these projects and CIMS. These points of impact could result in task\ndependencies between and/or across projects. (i.e. the ability to begin a task in CIMS\ncould be dependent upon the completion of an activity in an external project or vise-\nversa…) Significant measures are being taken during requirements collection to ensure\nthat these touch points have been adequately identified.\nImpact of projects external to CIMS is generally assumed to be outside the scope of the\nCIMS project, except where the CIMS requirements have incorporated their inclusion.",
