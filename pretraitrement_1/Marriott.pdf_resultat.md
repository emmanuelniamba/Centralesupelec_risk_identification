"content": "The Marriott Bedding Program set out to develop and implement a bedding package for over 628,000 beds across 10 Marriott lodging brands in two years, giving Marriott a new look and more comfortable amenities. The US$190 million global renovation required seamless coordination of resources from interior design, operations, finance, owner relations and public relations. In addition to transforming the Marriott brand, the finished product gave the company an important advantage and unique selling point over competitors. As bedding choices became a focal point of lodging industry competition, it was imperative for Marriott to conform to a tight project timeline with strong compliance across the Marriott system in order to reap the rewards of competitive advantage. The new bedding was part of a comprehensive initiative to transform the look and feel of all Marriott brands to create a more comfortable hotel experience for all guests.",

"section": "Stakeholder Endorsement",
"content": "Stakeholder endorsement of the Marriott Bedding Program was essential for implementation since owners and franchisees would bear primary responsibility for the necessary financial investment. Owners and franchisees are required to comply with Marriott standards and the introduction of new operational measures, but if they are not supportive of a change, the implementation process can be significantly delayed. In addition, at the time of the Bedding Program, some properties had just opened and the new bedding standards required them to dispose of relatively new linens, which posed a financial burden for some. With more than 143,000 employees worldwide and over 200 direct project associates, implementation of the bedding program required significant changes in hotel management processes. Thousands of people including housekeepers and laundry associates had to learn how to switch the new bedding out and also maintain the new standard form for each room and each linen change. Training had to be specific to the bedding packages designed for different brands. Additionally, property management teams needed to be educated about the rationale for the bedding change and the linen ordering process. Other training complications centered on a language barrier between property managers and housekeeping and laundry associates and the need to train all staff at the same level. In addition, some properties experienced staff turnover during the implementation process, requiring additional training for new personnel. Much of the bedding Marriott sought was manufactured and distributed from overseas companies. This created a six-month lag time between the time an order was placed and when linens were delivered. In addition, across all brands the Bedding Program involved over 1,850 different products such as mattresses, pillows, sheets, pillow cases, etc., which posed a challenge of tracking and distribution.",

"section": "Results",
"content": "of the Bedding Program. Marriott negotiated with vendors to obtain the best possible pricing so that owners would be encouraged to use Marriott’s procurement process. The negotiation process proved to be a challenge itself since Marriott could not forecast the volume of bedding purchases until the orders were placed, but owners would not commit to purchasing the bedding without price quotes. The procurement team negotiated preliminary pricing, prepared property-specific quotes for all properties and then obtained signed agreements from the owners. Continuous communication proved invaluable to gaining the support from property owners and franchisees. To resolve the challenges brought on by Marriott’s complex procurement process, Marriott contracted an outside distribution company to receive, repackage and ship the bulk of the bedding to the properties. This allowed the properties to receive complete orders - a Marriott requirement that reduced the risk of storage complications at properties that received items piece-meal. Within Marriott, each distribution team was responsible for tracking actual and projected shipments and shortfalls by item, by week. The distributions and procurement teams met with vendors every week to review manufacturing schedules and overseas shipping status reports and plan how to address shortfalls. To overcome language barriers while training staff, the project team developed wordless training videos and job aides with photos to demonstrate how the beds should be made. To keep up with staff turnover, Marriott leveraged an intranet web site where department or initiative information could be posted and easily accessed. Additionally, the project team conducted property conference calls during the ordering process and when the linens were shipped to reinforce written communications and ensure no confusion was created by a change in managers. In addition to the transformation of all bed linens across all Marriott brands and properties, the company saw an opportunity to save money and become more environmentally friendly through the establishment of a linen reuse program. The program mandates linens to be changed only as needed, upon guest request and between stays. This allows the hotels to conserve energy and water as well as reduce energy costs.",
