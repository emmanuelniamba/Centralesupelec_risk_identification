# MATTERS FROM STAFF AGENDA ITEM #15
## Board of County Commissioners - Staff Report

Meeting Date: July 3, 2018
Presenter: Sean O’Malley
Submitting Dept: Public Works
Subject: Consideration of a Project Charter for Tribal Trails Road

## Statement / Purpose
Consideration of approval of the Project Charter for Tribal Trails Road, in accordance with the Integrated Transportation Plan (ITP) approved in September 2015 by the Jackson Town Council and Teton County Commission.

## Background / Description (Pros &#x26; Cons)
Per Chapter 5 of the Integrated Transportation Plan, major capital projects specifically identified in the ITP are to be guided by a Project Charter. The Project Charter is to be initiated by the appropriate elected body. As the Board of County Commissioners have jurisdiction over the lands within the Tribal Trails Road project boundary, the BCC shall vote to initiate this project.

Among other elements, the Project Charter shall identify or describe the following: purpose and need for the project; project objectives; project location, project extents, and project elements; environmental review required; roles and responsibilities of the project development team, elected officials, and Stakeholder Committee; required resources including project cost, staff resources, professional services, and funding; and risk assessment.

On March 20, 2018, the County Commissioners voted to enter into a Cooperative Agreement with Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). Under the agreement, WYDOT will manage the design, approval and construction process for the Tribal Trails Road project. WYDOT will conduct all preliminary survey work, engineering investigations, environmental and right-of-way studies and will develop conceptual and final design plans and specifications. Teton County will be responsible for public outreach throughout the project. WYDOT will assist with public meetings and conduct any NEPA-required processes. Approval of the Tribal Trails Road project charter will mark the formal start of work by Teton County and WYDOT on the project.

## Stakeholder Analysis &#x26; Involvement
County staff, with assistance from Transportation Advisory Committee members, prepared this project charter.

## Fiscal Impact
Teton County’s FY2019 budget includes $400,000 for preliminary planning and design.

## Staff Impact

# TRIBAL TRAILS PROJECT CHARTER

## Project Description
To plan, design, and potentially construct the 2,600’ long segment of Tribal Trails Road that extends from Cherokee Lane north to Highway 22.

## Purpose and Need
### Purpose
- To provide travel redundancy and improved multi-modal connectivity between South Park neighborhoods and areas accessed by Highway 22, including Wilson, Teton Village, other West Bank neighborhoods, and eastern Idaho. Currently, motor vehicles making these connections must travel through the Y intersection (US Highways 26/89 and Wyoming Highway 22), adding to the congestion at this major crossroad. This poor connectivity limits options for better transit services as well as fire ambulance service to affected neighborhoods in West Jackson and parts of Teton County that include Boyles Hill, Cottonwood Park, Indian Trails, 3 Creeks, and Teton County School District #1 campuses.

### Need
- This project is needed to reduce vehicle miles of travel (VMT) associated with circuitous routing of traffic, to reduce local trips through the Y intersection, to improve emergency response, and to provide improved transit options.

## Project Objectives
- **Safety** - To improve emergency vehicle access and provide route redundancy in and around West Jackson and South Park.
- **Environmental Protection** – To provide better connectivity and capacity in order to reduce vehicle miles travelled and vehicle emissions.
- **Cost Effectiveness** – To reduce vehicle miles travelled and thus reduce travel costs for the community.
- **Roadway Network Compatibility** – To provide network redundancy to reduce local trips through the Y intersection. To minimize delays caused by maintenance operations and crashes on US-26/89 and WY-22. These events can isolate the Town from Teton Village, Wilson, and other West Bank areas.
- **Multimodal Function** – To provide more direct routing for START transit services and Teton County School District buses between South Park and the West Bank.

## Project Location, Extents and Elements
- The platted alignment for the unfinished portion of Tribal Trails Road is approximately 2,600’ long and extends north of the Tribal Trails Road/Cherokee Lane intersection to Highway 22. This project may also include improvements to the existing segment of Tribal Trails that is located between South Park Loop Road and Cherokee lane. Several

Specific issues will be evaluated during the planning and design process including:
- The location and design of the intersection with WY-22, taking into consideration the potential for a grade separation;
- The potential to use berms, landscaping or other barriers to reduce visual and noise impacts to existing neighborhoods;
- Roadway design features that discourage or prevent cut-through traffic from using this route as a shortcut to US-26/89 by way of either South Park Loop Road or High School Road;
- Roadway design features that slow vehicular speeds – including protected turn lanes, roundabouts, traffic calming features, or other intersection improvements; and,
- A grade separate crossing feature (bridge or underpass) for the WY-22 pathway.

## Project Process
Teton County has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). Under the agreement, WYDOT will manage the design, approval and construction process for this project. WYDOT will conduct all preliminary survey work, engineering investigations, environmental and right-of-way studies and will develop conceptual and final design plans and specifications. Environmental studies and public involvement will follow Teton County and/or the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as needed. Work will be pursued consistent with the Project Charter process as outlined in the Integrated Transportation Plan.

The County will be responsible for public outreach throughout the project. WYDOT will assist with public meetings and conduct any NEPA-required processes.

## Environmental Review
This project will meet the environmental review requirements of Teton County including, but not necessarily limited to, wetland mapping and environmental assessment. Any elements of the project that utilize federal funds, or otherwise trigger NEPA, will follow the NEPA review process.

## Identify Roles and Responsibilities
- Project Sponsor – Teton County
- Project Manager – Wyoming Department of Transportation
- Preliminary Project Team –
- WYDOT Planning and/or WYDOT Consultant
- Teton County Engineer or designee
- Teton County Planning Director or designee
- Teton County Transportation Coordinator
- START Director

## Pathways Coordinator
- Elected Body – Teton County Commission – (see MOU for BCC roles and responsibilities)
- Identify Stakeholder Committee responsibilities and select members
- Stakeholders may include, among others, neighborhood representatives, wildlife and environmental representatives, non-motorized advocates, school district representatives, emergency services personnel, a citizen at large, and representatives from the art, business, and tourism communities.
- Stakeholders shall provide perspective to inform the project development process.
- Stakeholders shall review and comment on pending decisions and actions.
- Stakeholders shall serve as an avenue of communication to the community concerning the project.
- The Stakeholder Committee shall set the general meeting schedule.
- The Stakeholder Committee will not have formal approval authority and will attempt to reach consensus on issues where possible. The Project Team will distill the Stakeholder Committee comments when consensus cannot be reached.
- The Stakeholder Committee shall publish meeting summaries.
- Public Engagement – The Project Team, in consultation with the Stakeholder Committee and Board of County Commissioners, shall determine public workshop schedule. A preliminary proposed schedule is attached to this Project Charter.

## Identify Required Resources
- Project Cost Estimate – per the memorandum of understanding with WYDOT, the current project estimate is $6,826,500. The estimate will be revised once a preferred alternative has been selected and designed.
- Staff Resources - to be determined.
- Professional Services – WYDOT will use a consultant for their project elements. Teton County will likely engage a facilitator for Stakeholder Committee oversight and public workshops.
- Funding Sources – the Teton County FY2019 budget has funds allocated for the initial project elements.

## Prepare Risk Assessment
- Determine ability to meet Project Objectives and risks of failure to do so
- Outcomes Risk - The risk of failing to achieve the Project Objectives is moderate to high. Failure to achieve the objectives would result in more congestion along the major roadway corridors, reduced safety for residents with respect to emergency service access, and reduced effectiveness of multimodal options.

Another possible risk is that the process is delayed or stalled by a lack of participation by all interest groups. To mitigate this risk, the Stakeholder Group will ideally be representative of all interest groups that are potentially affected. The Stakeholder group will also operate by consensus, rather than voting.

- Business Risk – Because any approved construction is unlikely to occur for several years, there is moderate risk that the project costs will exceed the estimates. Another associated risk is that the funding might not be available when the project is ready to be built. To mitigate these risks, project estimates should be updated frequently throughout the process and budget requests for the projects should be based on the latest available estimate – including a contingency.

## Transparency
- The charter shall be made available on the County’s website. Media releases and updates to elected official and the public will occur throughout the process.
- Initiate project-specific website.
