## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**PROBLEM OR ISSUE**
Our goal for this project is to install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to accommodate malls' and service stations' EV-charging needs.

**PURPOSE OF PROJECT**
The implementation of the 1,125 EV charging stations will reduce fossil-fuel emissions and have a positive impact on the environment. This will help fulfill Positive Charge's mission of being the world's largest EV-charging provider and reduce the environmental impact of fossil-fuel cars through our services.

As EVs become more prevalent, more EV-charging stations are needed to accommodate EV drivers' charging needs. The implementation of the 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to accommodate malls' and service stations' EV-charging "traffic" will reduce the lengths to which EV drivers would have to travel for their next charge. The implementation of the EV-charging stations will also result in a 24% profit for Positive Charge.

**GOALS / METRICS**
The project goal is to install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico and Canada. The metrics used to measure success will primarily be the following key performance indicators (KPIs): Revenue Growth, Client Retention Rate, and Customer Satisfaction.

**EXPECTED DELIVERABLES**
Install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada to accommodate malls' and service stations' EV-charging needs.

# PROJECT SCOPE
WITHIN            Operations engineers, project managers and field implementation engineers will work with third-party client site
SCOPE             personnel to install 1,125 EV charging stations at 116 locations across the US, Mexico, and Canada.

OUTSIDE OF        Positive Charge is not responsible for third-party / client’s locations preparatory work (e.g., permits for digging, city
SCOPE             region electricity-availability logistics, etc.). However, Positive Charge project managers can provide clients with a
checklist to ensure their locations are adequately prepared for the installation of our EV charging stations.

# RISKS, CONSTRAINTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS

## Risks
Though contract is signed, Operations still does not have approval for installation from cities of Denver and Yuma. Project management to work with both cities to ensure proper permitting, etc. in time for scheduled installations.

## Constraints
We have to "backfill" some key project management and field engineer positions to ensure we have people "on the ground" to manage EV stations' implementation.

## Assumptions
We assume that all permits for installation of EV-charging stations will be provided by clients by time of implementation.
