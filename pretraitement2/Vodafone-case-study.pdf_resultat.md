# PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE: VODAFONE USING PMI STANDARDS TO DELIVER A COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY PROJECT

## Challenge: A Highly Complex Network
At the end of 2017, one of Vodafone’s strategic customers requested that Vodafone replace its existing, obsolete network with a highly capable, fully managed Global Local Area Network (GLAN) in 42 different sites across the world. The Vodafone customer program delivery project team aimed to complete the project by November 2019. The contract was for five years of service.

Vodafone is one of the largest telecommunications corporations in the world, with mobile operations in 24 countries, partners with mobile networks in 42 more, fixed broadband service in 19 markets, and more than half a billion total customers.

## Key Results
- 10/10 Net Promoter Score from customer
- On-time delivery
- Cost savings in resource budget

“The project managers' skillful execution, which was aligned with PMI's standards, enabled the success of this project.”
- Ahmed ElGedwany, Senior Customer Portfolio Lead

## Schedule Pressure from the Start
Staying on track with the planned schedule was a concern, due to a delay in the contract sign-off. As a result of this delay, a lot of design changes occurred before the project was baselined, and Vodafone had to accommodate these changes until they reached a final agreement on the design with the customer.

# SOLUTION
## PMI standards for successful collaboration
Due to the complexity of the project, the project management team needed to work on defining a standard agreed-upon approach for the delivery of the project.

The project team conducted a number of workshops with the technical solution architects that successfully led to categorizing the customer’s sites across the world and agreeing on a standard delivery approach to each category based on its priority.

The customer site priority levels are categorized as follows:
- Low complexity offices
- Medium complexity showrooms
- High complexity subsidiary factories
- Top headquarters that integrated offices and factories

Using a project management approach based on PMI standards:
- Workshops were conducted with suppliers to agree on the needed resources listed in the resource management plan.
- Part of the project budget was dedicated for a walkthrough of the customer’s top priority sites.
- A communication plan was set to ensure timely and effective communication was established.
- A formal change control process was formulated.
- Tailored project documentation was created to report and control the progress of the delivery.
- A tailored risk management plan and an issue log were set to track all the risks and issues within the project.
- Dependencies and impact were measured.
- A regular project analysis and a governance model were set and agreed.
- The project team agreed to capture lessons learned regularly instead of documenting these at the end of the project.

# RESULTS
ON-TIME PROJECT DELIVERY WITH COST SAVINGS

The first batch of customer site migrations to the new GLAN was delivered with a 90% success rate, and 100% of the sites migrated at the second attempt.

The Vodafone GLAN project was successfully delivered on time and ahead of the team’s target completion dates.

Through the use of proven project management waterfall methodology standardized by PMI:

- The customer gave Vodafone a 10/10 Net Promoter Score (NPS).
- Vodafone was able to deliver the project on time.
- Vodafone had cost savings in the resources budget.
- The project team captured the lessons learned to be used as a best practice for other future GLAN projects.
- Lessons learned sessions were conducted with the product team to share with them the best practice used for the GLAN product and what is its needs.

“Our project team worked with the customer to understand how the solution would benefit their business. Then using the PMI standards, they implemented the solution on time with high quality.”

- Adam Hyde, Head of Customer Design &#x26; Delivery
