# CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
Government is due to publish a new England Tree Strategy later this year (2020). It focuses on expanding, protecting and improving woodlands so that trees and woodlands can connect more people to nature, support the economy, combat climate change and recover biodiversity. The draft strategy sets out policy priorities to deliver an ambitious national tree planting programme.

The Forestry Commission is the government department responsible for protecting, expanding and promoting the sustainable management of woodlands and it has a target to increase UK woodland from 13% of all land cover to 19% by 2050.

City of York Council has set a goal to plant 50,000 trees by 2023 to support the national effort and to help achieve York’s wider ambition to be net carbon neutral by 2030. Tree canopy cover in York is 10.8% against a national (England) average of 10%.¹

The city is signatory to the Northern Forest initiative that aims to plant 50 million trees across northern England. Woodland cover in northern England is currently just 7.6% of all land cover, well below the UK (13%) and England averages.

It is also a member of the White Rose Forest partnership, a joint venture involving councils and environmental bodies working to support woodland creation across the Leeds City Region and York.

The project makes the following strategic links:

- Work currently underway by York and North Yorkshire LEP to define a carbon abatement pathway. Planting of woodland is considered an important carbon negative intervention in any pathway with a need to significantly increase the amount of woodland across York and North Yorkshire.

- Planning positively for the creation, protection, enhancement and management of York’s green infrastructure is a key part of the city’s emerging new Local Plan.

- Helping deliver York’s strategic health priorities. There is significant evidence demonstrating the positive public health benefits of green space including help with physical and mental health, obesity, dementia and autism.

- Creating opportunities for people to walk and cycle in woodland helps drive progress towards more active travel and healthier lifestyles – a central feature of the city’s Transport Plan.

# AIM &#x26; OBJECTIVES

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a large new area of woodland within close proximity to the city in order to provide green amenity space for residents and visitors, and to aid the council’s commitment to planting 50,000 trees by 2023.

This goal comes as part of the council’s wider ambition to become net carbon neutral by 2030, and supports the emerging blue &#x26; green infrastructure strategy and pollinator strategy.

Users of this woodland, and the wider community surrounding it, will benefit from this project as it provides them with a space to socialise, exercise and be educated about nature and biodiversity.

Executive (27 August 2020) approved a draft high level vision for the project to be consulted on as part of the early community and stakeholder engagement work:

“The new woodland will be a well-designed, biodiverse green space providing a place for peaceful contemplation and leisure for the people of York. It will create a new Stray for the city, enhance the setting of the city and make York an even greater place to live work and visit.”

## Objectives
- Increase amenity green space by 194 acres / 78 hectares, providing new outdoor leisure opportunities, areas for physical activity, walking and cycling, new educational opportunities and linking up York’s green corridors.

- Plant a minimum of 50,000 trees that will sequester CO2 to support net-zero, improve local air quality and reduce flood risk.

- Create new commercial activity that will fund management/maintenance of the forest and provide new employment, volunteering and green skills development opportunities.

- Leverage other public and private sector investment to expand tree planting within the city.

# PROJECT SCOPE
The site for the new woodland currently comprises 190+ acres of arable farmland to the west of the city between the villages of Knapton and Rufforth and fully within the York local authority boundary. Discussions are ongoing regarding other parcels of land adjacent to or close by the site that offer scope to plant more trees and simplify access and layout of the woodland.

The current site is deemed large enough to achieve the council’s tree planning target of 50,000 trees and create amenity green space in the west of the city that meets the requirements of the draft Local Plan.

The location is close to the urban footprint of York and to existing sustainable transport links.

The council’s Executive (13 February 2020) agreed a £3 million budget to purchase pieces of land over a period of 5 years to plant trees. There are multiple sources of potential external funding including the government’s Nature for Climate programme, Countryside Stewardship and Woodland Carbon Fund. Further work is required to establish the levels of grant available to ensure the financial impact to the council can be mitigated as much as possible.

A broad range of council services are within scope of the project including officers working on climate reduction, property and assets, health and wellbeing, sustainable transport, public rights of way, countryside and ecology, policy and city partnerships, communications, learning and skills, ward committees and democratic services.

## Approach
Project delivery will be through a partnership approach facilitated by City of York Council.

Membership of the White Rose Forest partnership provides access to a range of expertise throughout the various stages of the woodland design process, including how to design an amenity woodland, the species of trees to be planted and sustainable long term management. It also provides a link into funding opportunities available throughout the WRF Delivery Pathway and assistance in making funding bids.

A stakeholder advisory group made up of informed local residents, charitable trusts and other professionals will be established to inform development and management proposals that meet Forestry Commission regulatory requirements and these will be brought before the council’s Executive for agreement.

Ongoing community and stakeholder engagement will ensure local residents, community and charitable groups have an opportunity to shape woodland design.

# LAYOUT AND AMENITIES
There is likely to be a requirement to commission detailed survey work to better understand site conditions such as habitats, historic environment, biodiversity, soil, water, landscape, utilities and access that will feed into the Forestry Commission’s screening for Environmental Impact Assessment and woodland approval.

Likewise, a detailed site master plan and phased site development plan will also require professional input. The aim is commence tree planting at scale during the 2021/22 planting season.

## Outcomes Expected
- A nature based solution to climate change mitigation as part of a local, national and international pathway to net zero carbon. Based on a site of 194 acres / 78 hectares and depending upon the density of planting and species of tree, the woodland could sequester approximately 28,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over 50 years.
- A new amenity woodland connecting more people with nature via new/enhanced nature rich active travel corridors joining up the city’s green infrastructure and improving peoples’ health and wellbeing.
- More diverse habitats to support wildlife and the recovery of threatened species.
- New employment, volunteering and nature based learning opportunities through woodland creation and longer term woodland management as part of York’s growing green economy.
- Opportunities for greater public involvement in nature, improving awareness of, and skills for, nature conservation.
- New opportunities for community engagement and the establishment of new local groups.

## Outputs

# PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN

## Site Surveys
Undertake relevant site surveys to fully understand the site and inform project development and detailed woodland design. This feeds into FC EIA regulatory requirements and helps shape final woodland design.

## Community Co-Designed Vision
Develop a community co-designed high level vision and key objectives for the site through early community and stakeholder engagement. This high level vision would consider the principle purpose of the new woodland including carbon sequestration, amenity value, improving health and wellbeing, wildlife and biodiversity, employment and skills.

## Detailed Site Masterplan
Develop a detailed site masterplan. The site masterplan will detail the layout/design of the new woodland to meet the agreed vision and key objectives. The woodland scheme could incorporate a number of features including new pedestrian walkways, cycle routes, fitness trails, an outdoor play area, forest school space, woodland café and commercial use to sustain site operations/management.

## Forestry Commission Requirements
Meet all necessary Forestry Commission requirement re. UKFS and EIA. FC approval is required before woodland creation can commence on the site and capital funding can be secured.

## Phased Woodland Creation Implementation Plan
Develop a phased woodland creation implementation/delivery plan. This plan would guide physical works required to create the new woodland.

## Long-Term Sustainable Woodland Management Arrangements
Identify and put in place long-term sustainable woodland management arrangements. This would build on early community and stakeholder engagement and ideally present opportunities for local people to be involved. There will be examples of other community woodland we can learn from.

## Assumptions
- Sufficient dedicated staff resource/capacity will be available to drive and support delivery of the project.
- Partners within WRF and beyond will be fully engaged and pro-actively support project design and delivery.

Detailed site surveys do not identify significant barriers to meeting the project’s aims and objectives.

That plans for the site meet all regulatory requirements and strive for best practice.

There is widespread community support and active engagement in the project to ensure a sustainable future for the woodland as a valued amenity space.

That long-term woodland management options fully explore opportunities for the local community and charitable trusts to take a lead role.

# DEPENDENCIES
The project links to the following work and initiatives within City of York Council:

- Carbon reduction and climate adaptation programme: Carbon sequestration will be an important component of York’s emerging carbon reduction pathway towards net zero carbon.

- Local Plan/Green Infrastructure Strategy: Planning positively for the creation, protection, enhancement and management of York’s green infrastructure networks is part of the emerging new Local Plan/s strategic approach to spatial development.

- Health and wellbeing strategy: This recognises the important role that York’s landscapes, geodiversity, biodiversity and natural environment play in supporting healthy communities.

- Draft pollinator strategy: Currently under development, the Strategy aims to protect pollinating insects which support our food production and the diversity of our environment.

- Sustainable transport: The strategy prioritises active travel and supports this by creating opportunities for residents to walk and cycle.

- York Outer Ring Road (ORR) A1237 project: This presents further opportunity to invest in trees, woodland and fauna and flora on land adjacent to the ORR.

- Major projects: Work is ongoing to take forward opportunities for tree planting across the city and to promote tree planning as part of development activity, as can be seen by the outline planning application for York Central.
