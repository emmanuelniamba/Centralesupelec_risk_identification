# SECTION I – PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

## 1.0 Purpose
The purpose of this grant activity is to contribute towards improved functionality rate of water supply facilities, increased access to water and increased access to sanitation in underserved areas of Zambia.

## 1.1 Project Description
RTI International (RTII) was awarded the USAID Expanding Water and Sanitation Project in January 2022. The purpose of the USAID Expanding Water and Sanitation Project (USAID Expanding WASH) is to professionalize WASH services, to promote accountability for reliable and high-quality WASH services, and to enhance the enabling environment for private sector engagement (PSE) in service delivery in underserved areas of Zambia (Northern, Western and Muchinga provinces). The period of award is five-years. The overall objective of USAID Expanding WASH project is to maintain and expand sustainable WASH services in peri-urban, rural growth centers, and rural areas of Muchinga, Northern, Western and Southern Provinces in 12 selected districts namely Chinsali, Nakonde, Mpika, Lunte, Mungwi, Kazungula, Kalomo, Nalolo, Kalabo, Mongu, Kaoma and Sesheke. Over the course of a five-year period, the project targets to increase access to water by 15% and increase access to sanitation by 25%. The three objectives for the project are:
- Objective 1: Institutionalize market-based WASH service delivery, with financially sustainable and inclusive management models.
- Objective 2: Increase the accountability of WASH service providers, policymakers, and civic leaders.
- Objective 3: Increase private sector participation (PSP).

## 1.2 Grants Activity
The general poor state of WASH infrastructure is a significant contributor to the low availability of water in the rural areas, whereas effective infrastructure O&#x26;M management is critical to ensuring sustainable and functional WASH systems. The project recognizes the strategic role played by District Water Sanitation and Hygiene (D-WASHE) and Village Water Sanitation and Hygiene (V-WASHE) committees in identification of sites for rehabilitation, coordination of infrastructure upgrade, identification of Area Pump Menders (APMs) and facilitation and development of appropriate enabling environment and entry point private sector engagement. This grant activity seeks to build capacity of District Water Sanitation and Hygiene (D-WASHE) and Village Water Sanitation and Hygiene (V-WASHE) committees, Area Pump menders (APMs) and Community Champions (CCs), with an objective to increase functionality rate of water supply facilities, increase access to water and increase access to sanitation. The project seeks to work with eligible Enterprise or, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), excluding GRZ institutions, who will undertake specific capacity building activities as described below.
- A. Under objective 1, Task 1.2.4- Orient and build capacity in D-WASHE committees, V-WASHE committees and Area Pump Menders (APMs) in the Operation, Maintenance and Management of water points.
</page1>
# OBJECTIVE 1
## Task 1.3.3
Build capacity in Community champions (CCs) to implement sanitation behavioral change activities that will address open defecation and improve access to basic sanitation in the target populations.

## Support Equipment
Distribute support equipment (Bicycles, Toolkits and Smart Phones) to APMs, CCs and Environmental Health Technicians (EHTs). Grant recipients will implement the above activities in the 5 selected districts of Northern and Muchinga province that USAID Expanding WASH project is working in. In developing their budgets, applicants should include relevant costs relating to Activity A, B and C above. However, note that under Activity C – Support Equipment (Bicycles, Toolkits and Smart Phones), these will be procured directly by USAID Expanding WASH Project and will be provided as an in-kind grant for distribution by the Grantee. Therefore, for Activity C, applicants should include in their budgets only the costs related to distribution.

The proposed grant activities must be within the framework of the following sub-objectives and tasks and conform to overall USAID Expanding WASH objectives.

## Sub-Objective 1.2
Enhance Construction Quality of Small-Scale Water Systems (New and Rehabilitated Hand Pump Boreholes and Small Piped-water Schemes)

### Task 1.2.4
Orient and build capacity in D-WASHE committees, V-WASHE committees and Area Pump Menders in the Operation, Maintenance and Management of water points.

#### Activities:
- Orient the D-WASHE committees and V-WASHE committees in sustainable Operation, Maintenance and Management of selected water points. In addition, developing enabling environment for private sector participation.
- Conduct needs assessment and undertake practical training APMs on repair of non-functional boreholes with hand pumps.
- Equipping APMs: As part of this activity, new water point tool kits for the repair of water points will be procured by the project, as an in-kind grant to the Grantee, and will be distributed by the Grantee under an improved tool kit management system at district and subdistrict level. The target is to train 120 APMs and procure and distribute 30 special &#x26; standard tool kits covering all the 5 districts.

## Sub-Objective 1.3
Facilitate Access for the Poor to Adequate Sanitation Facilities

### Task 1.3.3
Train CCs to be selected from the 5 target districts on ways to address open defecation and improve access to basic sanitation in the target populations with a market-based approach that supports supply chain development in the construction of toilets.

#### Activities:
- Building of capacity in 90 CC covering all the 5 selected districts. The training will enable CCs to mobilize communities and effectively disseminate sanitation behavioral change messages in villages.
- Equipping the CCs: Distribute 90 Bicycles to be procured by the project and awarded to the grantee as an in-kind grant.
- Monitoring and Reporting: Distribute 35 Smartphones procured by the project and awarded to the grantee, as an in-kind grant, for EHTs to monitor activities and report progress on water and sanitation activities.

# PRE-AWARD ASSESSMENTS

## Pre-Award Assessments
RTII must be fully satisfied that the applicant has the capacity to adequately perform in accordance with the principles established by USAID. An award can be made only after RTII makes a positive determination that the applicant possesses, or can obtain, the necessary management competence to carry out the grant activity and will practice mutually agreed upon methods of accountability for funds and other assets funded by USAID. At a minimum, RTII will conduct a pre-award assessment on selected applicants to make determination of responsibility.

## Unique Entity Identifier (UEI):
Beginning April 4, 2022, the Unique Entity ID (UEI) from SAM.gov is the authoritative identifier for those doing business with the federal government. The DUNS Number is no longer valid for federal award identification. The Unique Entity ID is generated in SAM.gov (www.sam.gov). If you are registered in SAM.gov (active or not), you already have a Unique Entity ID. It is viewable at SAM.gov. Whereas applicants can submit their applications without the UEI number, however, grant recipients must provide the UEI before they can receive any funding. Due to delays in processing of UEIs, applicants are encouraged to apply for the number early.
