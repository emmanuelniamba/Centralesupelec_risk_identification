"section": "Project Summary",
"content": "1.     Project Overview\nSince the 1980s, the Bank Group has accumulated considerable experience in building retail\nMicrofinance Institution’s (MFI’s) capacity in Regional Member Countries (RMCs), building\ninclusive financial systems that work for the poor, as well as ensuring increased access to\nmicro finance services for women and men. The Bank has been involved in supporting\nmicro‑finance in Uganda since 1994 with the Poverty Alleviation Project (PAP 1994‑1998).\nBuilt on the lessons learnt from the implementation of PAP, the Bank responded to a GoU\nrequest to finance the follow‑up phase ‑ Rural Microfinance Support Project I (RMSP) (2000‑\n2008). The lessons learnt from these projects are outlined below and details are further\navailable in project completion reports.\nThe Bank’s Microfinance Policy and Strate        gy (2006) recognizes that the following\nconstraints continued to erode RMCs’ capacity to ensure sustainable financial services at the\nlocal level: (i) the absence of strong retail capac ity in microfinance institutions; (ii) extending\naccess of financial services to rural areas, wher e most of the poor are concentrated in a cost‑\neffective manner; and (iii) weak institutional infrastructure, including service providers such\nas training institutes, accountancy services, credit reference bureaus and appropriate\ninformation technologies. Through the lessons learnt from its operations, the Bank has made\na strategic decision to intervene selectively in support of improved access to microfinance\ndevelopment. The Bank would also build on its extensive experience to support only those\nareas which prove to have a direct impact on  poverty reduction for women and men in rural\nareas. In this regard, the present operation de monstrates clear elements of sustainable poverty\nreduction, employment and income generation for the rural poor in Uganda. This will be\nachieved through building sustainable rural microfinance infrastructure. The proposed project\nshall be implemented in five years at a total cost of UA 12.01 million.\nThe proposed project is expected to contribute to MSC’s Strategic Plan 2009‑2014. The direct\nbeneficiaries of the proposed program will be 1.4 million of the rural population in Uganda,\nparticularly women who do not have access to financial services. The project will also build\nrural financial infrastructure and enhance their linka ges to mainstream financial institutions such\nas commercial banks through linkage banking and sharing client information. It will also\npromote savings and credit culture among the target rural population and enhance their business\nmanagement skills through training.  Overall, the project is expected to enhance the livelihood of\nthe rural population, therefore contributing to GoU’s efforts to reduce poverty and meet the\nMDGs targets.",

"section": "Needs Assessment",
"content": "In the past two decades, the microfinance industry in Uganda has transformed from infancy\nto a sector with a significant contribution to the economy. An assessment of the microfinance\nindustry in 2007 by FINSCOPE Uganda showed that the cliental base increased from 300,000\nin 1997 to 3.5 million in 2007, 60% of whom are women. By 2006 there were 1,271 Tier four\nfinancial institutions in Uganda, of which approximately 70% are Savings and Credit\nCooperatives (SACCOS), NGOs and other microfinance institutions which are not supervised\nby the Bank of Uganda. Nevertheless, FINSCOPE study also revealed that: 62% of Ugandans\nstill have no access to formal financial services; 71% of those who save do not bank; 54%\nreceive credit from friends and relatives; and approximately 70% of rural populations,",

"section": "Bank’s Added Value",
"content": "The proposed Bank intervention is guided by the comparative advantage it acquired by building the basic microfinance infrastructure and its long sustained engagement with the GoU in the development of industry policy and a regulatory framework which is built on international best practice principles. Furthermore, the Bank’s main areas of strength include:\nincreased understanding and knowledge  of microfinance industry in Uganda; its contribution to the design and implementation of legislation and regulations that govern the microfinance industry in Uganda; and significant experience in the delivery and sequencing of interventions, such as focusing on capacity building before injecting credit. The Bank is also better positioned since it supported the creation of the Microfinance Support Centre (MSC) in 2001, which has been designated by the GoU as a linchpin Apex to wholesale credit funds,\ndevelop business services, and coordinate GOU interventions and mobilize resources for the development of the microfinance industry in Uganda. The Bank’s lead role in the microfinance industry in Uganda also gives it an added advantage regarding appreciation of sector needs and issues. Supporting the proposed  project, therefore, demonstrates the Bank’s commitment to engage with GoU in prioritizing and addressing the delivery of microfinance services to the rural poor in Uganda.",

"content": "1.1. Project linkages with country strategy and objectives\n1.1.1  The GoU’s Poverty Eradication Action     Plan (PEAP) includes microfinance under\nPillar 2 ‑ “increasing production, competitiv  eness of Uganda’s products and household\nincomes”. The strategy specifically recognizes that microfinance can act as a catalyst for\nenhancing productivity and competitiveness and the incomes and savings of poor households.\nTo stimulate the implementation of these strategies, the GOU also prepared the Prosperity for\nAll (PFA) programme. Under PFA, rural financ      ial services features as one of the key\nstrategic areas that need urgent intervention in  order to increase access of financial services\nby the rural poor,  enhance household income and to stimulate savings and investment. The\nprogram emphasizes the need to enhance produc tion, competitiveness and commercialization\nof the economy. This is to be achieved through increased production and productivity,\npromoting value addition and marketing, improved access to information and increased\naccess to affordable financial services. The above mentioned pillar supports pro‑poor growth\nand poverty reduction and is fully in harmony with the Bank’s Microfinance Policy and\nStrategy (2006); Medium Term Strategic Plan 2008‑2012 which promotes building inclusive\nfinancial systems that complement the  private‑se ctor efforts. The Project also falls within the\nUJAS priorities under pillar 2. See Annex A1: Uganda’s development agenda and donor\nsupport.\n1.2. Rationale for Bank’s involvement\n1.2.1  Assessment of the microfinance indu   stry in 2007 by FINSCOPE Uganda revealed\nthat: 62% of Ugandans have no access to fina  ncial services; 71% of those who save do not\nbank; 54% receive credit from friends and re     latives; and approximately 70% of rural\npopulations and women are without access        to financial services. A 2008 study on\n“Constraints in Access to and Demand for Ru    ral Credit: Evidence  from Uganda,” by Paul\nMpuga, revealed that rural households are at a disadvantage in terms of demand for credit. In\n1999, the study found that the average amount of credit applied for was about US$78.4 while\nabout US$40 was on average received by the a     pplicants. In general lo an applications for\nindividuals from rural areas were found to be 45% smaller than those of their urban\ncounterparts. In terms of the demand for credit by urban and rural areas, it is estimated that\nabout 40% and 50% of the credit demand by the urban and rural population respectively have\nnot been met.\n1.2.2  It was also found that: (i) lending to agriculture remains the least covered (the\nexcluded category) by formal financial institutions compared to lending to trade and\ncommerce; and (ii) community based  financial institutions such as SACCOS are very\nimportant in meeting the credit needs of rural households. The study therefore, concluded\n                                             1",

"content": "that: (a) there is limited supply of credit to  the agricultural sector, the mainstay of rural\npopulation which constitutes 80% of the poor and contributes more than 38% of the GDP; (b)\nGovernment targeted credit programs play a critical role in assisting rural households in\naccessing credit; and (c) local community savings and credit cooperatives are more\nresponsive given the absence of formal financial institutions in rural areas.\n1.2.3   As a result of the financial crisis, the foreign direct investment in Uganda fell by 5\npercent in FY 2008/09 and there was a reversal of portfolio capital inflows, from a net inflow\nUS$ 66.30 million in FY 2007/08 to a net outflow US$108.95 million in FY 2008/09. Many\nof the foreign investors faced liquidity shortages as a result of the global financial crisis and\nresponded by pulling funds out of emerging markets. Private remittances to Uganda are\nestimated to have declined by 24 percent in FY 2008/09 compared to the previous year,\nespecially as industrialized economies took a hit in terms of reduced GDP growth and market\nliquidity. While some of the sectors which are highly dependant on imported inputs have seen\na decline, the services and manufacturing sectors proved resilient to the impact of the global\ncrisis and, therefore, have helped to support the overall GDP growth rate in the face of the\nsupply side and demand side shocks. The services sector grew by 9 percent in FY 2008/09,\ndown from 10 percent in FY 2007/08 while the 7 percent growth rate of manufacturing in FY\n2008/09 was also only slightly less than in the previous year. The growth in informal cross\nborder trade exports to the region, which are dominated by manufactured goods, has provided\nan important boost in demand for this sector. The agricultural sector grew by 2.6 percent in\nFY 2008/09 which was double the growth rate in FY 2007/08 on account of increased\ndemand for food in the region. As such the GOU has established a focused policy to target\nthe support of these sectors which are mainly rural‑based.\n1.2.4  Based on the GOU proactive policies to support rural based economic growth, all\nanalysis and projections estimate an increase in demand for rural financial services by at least\n35% by 2015, as the GOU rolls out its PFA programme, which focuses on reforms related to\nemployment generation, increasing food security and increasing regional trade and private\nsector investment opportunities. The GOU has estima ted that in order to continue on the path\nof sustained economic growth, broad‑based participation from the small and micro\nentrepreneurs will be imperative both for the service and productive industry. As such, the\nRIEEP will respond to the GOU plans to meet this emerging need for increased access to\nfinancial services contributing to economic growth in the priority sectors. Annex 1 provides\nthe demand estimate of at least 2,934 new wholesale loans to be generated by the period\n2014. It should be recognized that: (i) the pr   oposed project is the third operation to be\nfinanced by the Bank in Uganda; (ii) MSC was created by GOU in close collaboration with\nthe Bank with the aim of establishing a viable and sustainable institution with the potential to\nexpand outreach and increase the access of the rural poor in Uganda to financial services; (iii)\nDuring the implementation of the previous two operations, the Bank learned important\nlessons that will enhance the achievement of the project objective (see section 2.7).",

However, since 2006, upon the completion of a number of\ndonor‑supported microfinance projects, partners have not renewed their engagement in this\nindustry.

The Islamic Development Bank approved in April 2009 a facility of UA 6.8\nmillion to GoU for MSC. The IsDB project will provide USD9.7 million to support the  credit\nneeds of rural clients and a grant of USD 0.30 million for capacity building of rural financial\nintermediaries. DANIDA, together with SIDA and the EU, has recently approved the Agri‑\nBusiness Initiative under their U‑Growth programme. The total programme amount is EURO\n32 million of which about EURO 6.6 million is                                                                     allocated to increasing access to financial\nservices to rural financial intermediaries and strengthening local commercial banks. IFAD\ncontinues to implement its existing programme, worth USD 18.34 million, on supporting\ncapacity building of SACCOs and other rural MF Is. The existing project is ending in 2011 at\nwhich point IFAD will evaluate its achievement s under this intervention.

Participatory process for project identification, design and\nimplementation\n2.6.1  The proposed Project was conceived following a long consultative process which\nstarted in 2006 as RMSP was approaching completion. This included a country‑wide\nconsultation process on the new Rural Development Strategy which covered all sub‑counties\nin Uganda. The process culminated in the policy workshop on SACCO regulation which took\nplace from 12‑15 October 2008 and was attended by all relevant stakeholders. The key\noutcomes of this consultative process were: (i) lack of access of financial services by the rural\npoor due to either absence or lack of capacity of MFIs; (ii) need to formulate a policy and\nregulatory framework for the 4 MFIs (non BoU supervised financial institutions); and (iii)\nenhanced coordination of the microfinance industry. The MSC held its consultative process\nto formulate its strategic plan for the period  2009‑2014 followed by discussions with Uganda\nCooperative Alliance (UCA), Uganda Cooperative Savings and Credit Union (UCSCU),\nNational Environment Management Agency (NEMA), Post Bank Uganda; National\nAgricultural Advisory and Development Services (NAADS), Association of Microfinance\nInstitution in Uganda (AMFIU), Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI),\nParliamentarians and selected SACCOs.",

"content": "2.7.1  The Bank has been involved in supporting micro‑finance in Uganda since 1994 with\nthe Poverty Reduction Project (PAP 1994‑1998). Built on the lessons learnt from the\nimplementation of PAP, the Bank responded to a GoU request to finance the follow‑up phase\n‑ Rural Microfinance Support Project (RMSP) (2000‑2008). At completion RMSP achieved\nits development objectives notably: increased incomes of the Partner Organization (PO)\nclients by over 10%; deepened outreach of microfinance services to rural areas and serving\n70,794 clients of whom 55% were women; achieved loan repayment rate of 95% and\nportfolio at risk of less than 6%; realized savings of 12% of the outstanding loan portfolio of\nPOs; and enhanced skills through training of 2,600 staff of 428 POs, 71,000 clients and 88\nMSC staff. This enabled MSC to strengthen the institutional infrastructure to deliver financial\nservices to the rural poor allowing a number of MFIs and MSC, such as FINCA, UMU and\nUWFT, to graduate and transform into Micro Deposit‑taking Institutions (MDIs) in 2004/5.\n2.7.2  The proposed project builds on the achievements of the previous phases and seeks to\nconsolidate the capacity and outreach as well as expand access to financial services by the\nrural poor. The RIEEP is designed to support the GoU’s second Strategic and Business Plans\nfor the Microfinance Support Centre (MSC‑2009‑ 2014) and is built on the following lessons\nsummarized below that have been integrated into the new Project.\n2.7.3  Policy stability: The experience from RMSP indicated that the implementation of the\nproject was affected by the GOU policy shift which required that MSC focus on SACCOs\nonly. This was mainly due to GoU’s genuine concern on the slow progress in expanding\noutreach of financial services to rural areas. The GOU has since proposed a new policy for\nTier four financial institutions and is working on a regulatory framework that will enhance\ntheir effectiveness in order to expand outreach and access to financial services in rural areas.\n2.7.4  Conflict Resolution:  As a result of the aforementioned policy shift, the RMSP had\nsuffered from a period of suspension of disbursements. However, both the Bank and GOU\nremained in a constructive dialogue and engagement at the time which led to a quick\nresolution of outstanding issues and better management practices. In addition, an industry\nwide Collaboration Secretariat was established at MSC in order to resolve policy and\noperational issues.\n2.7.5  Institutional Transformation:  It is important to recognize that transforming public\ninstitutions to corporate entities is a long and delicate process requiring a lot of preparedness\nand continued support on the part of the Borrower and the Bank. This is aimed to consolidate\nthe achievements made to date and complete MSC’s transformation to a full‑fledged apex\ninstitution which wholesale funding and provide technical service to fourth tier MFIs in\nUganda. This presents a sustainable home‑grown model with potential to deepen outreach of\nmicrofinance services to the active poor in rural Uganda.\n2.7.6  Institutional sustainability : In order for MSC to continue to provide the nationwide\nsupport as an apex financial institution, it needed to graduate from a project to a fully\nfunctional business entity. This has been achieved through registration of MSC as a limited\nliability company with a clear operational and business plan. Annex B1 presents lessons\nlearned from a sample of ADF financed projects in Uganda.",

For\ndetailed analysis refer to Annex B7.\n3.1.2  Considering the prevailing market interest rates and demand for microfinance\nservices, it is expected that: (i) the average lo  an size for the commercial loan product will\nincrease from UGX 52.00 million (UA 15,000) to UGX 330.00 million (UA 95,400) and\nfrom UGX 50.00 million (UA 14,546) to UG           X 370.00 million (UA 106,975) for the\nagricultural loan product; (ii)  the loan portfolio will grow from UGX 30.72 billion (UA 9\nmillion) in YR 1 to UGX 182.98 billion (Ua 53 million) by YR 5; (iii) loan disbursements are\nprojected to grow from UGX 25.12 billion (UA       7.2 million) in YR 1to UGX 68.09 billion\n(UA 20 million) in YR 3 and UGX 130 billion (UA 38 million) by YR 5; (iv) the number of\nPartner Organisations (POs) a nd POs clients will  reach 2,934 and 1,467,000 respectively by\nYR 5.\n3.1.3   Some key indicators presented in the table below show that the yield on portfolio is\nprojected to improve from the current 9.1% to 12% in YR 1. MSC is expected to control\ncosts such that operating cost ratio is projecte d to improve from 20% in Year 1 to 7% in Year\n3 and 4% by Year 5. The staffs in both HQ         and Zonal offices is projected to operate\noptimally such that the ratio of FSOs to total number of staff will be 60% by Year 5 which is\nin accordance with sound practices. The average case load (borrowers per zone) will be 75\nloans over the project implementation period.\n3.1.4.  In order to supply their services on a sustainable basis, it is imperative that MSC\nmaintain high repayment rates.  It is projected  that annualised loan write‑off ratio will not be\nmore than 2% per annum.  Loan loss provision will not go beyond 5%. Loan repayment will\nnot go below 95%.",

Further analysis of\npotential businesses to be s   upported by the MSC partner organisations shows that on the\naverage the local economy in each Zone is expected to be injected by at least 4.5% new and\nrenewed local investments.

"section": "Environmental and Social impacts",
"content": "3.3     Environmental and Social impacts\nEnvironment\n3.3.1  The proposed project is category IV. This is justified on grounds that the project activity is the wholesaling of funds to financial intermediaries and no direct physical infrastructure investments are envisaged. The proposed project, therefore, will not require environmental and social mitigation measures. The National Environment Management Agency (NEMA) is a collaborating partner with MSC, whose main role will be the development of guidelines and training of clients on project appraisal for funding especially in fragile environments and ecosystems. Annex B8 presents the Environmental and social management plan analysis.\nGender\n3.3.2  The vast majority of clients of Ugandan MFIs are women: loans to female clients constitute around 75% of the loan portfolio and 80% of the savings portfolio (MFPED 2000). Some microfinance providers like FINCA, FOCCAS or UWFT only target female clients. Most MFIs focus on women for two reasons. First, lending to women is thought to benefit the whole family and strengthen the role of women in society. The second reason is that women, like in most other parts of the world, have proven to be better in repaying loans compared to their male counterparts. In some cases, female‑only MFIs accept men if they replace their deceased wives. CERUDEB, a commercial microfinance provider with slightly larger average loans than most other MFIs, pursues an equal access policy and asks for collateral. This sometimes excludes women. However, it is not uncommon that a loan is in the husband’s name but the woman is running the business. In most microfinance institutions, especially in those only targeting women, at least half of the workforce is female. While MFIs increasingly recruit female credit officers and women constitute approximately half of senior management (varying from organization to organization), board members are still mainly men. Although most MFIs in Uganda specifically target women, only a few have altered their methodology in significant ways for this reason. Most microfinance providers feel that women’s empowerment is an important aspect of financial service provision, but that they are first of all obliged to seek efficiency and sustainability in order to guarantee durable access to financial services to as large a number of poor clients as possible.\n3.3.3  The Project will reach at least 50% female beneficiaries in all regions. Based on analysis of a sample of enterprises, it is envisaged that the income of female headed households will increase at least by USD 320 per month as a result of the injection of new access to finance. The project will also support gender sensitization training in all its capacity building activities as well as require that all financial intermediaries provide a report to MSC on the gender balanced outreach of their clientele. Further gender responsive monitoring mechanisms will also be built into the new MIS at the MSC, and periodic reports to the Board and Bank will report gender disaggregated data as relates to the project impact.\nSocial\n3.3.4  The Project will contribute to the empowerment of more than 1.4 million poor and low income rural households in Uganda, of which 50% are women. Access to financial services will enable the rural poor to improve their well‑being both at the individual and household level. The average income of borrowers among MSC partner organizations is",

"section": "IV – IMPLEMENTATION",
"content": "4.1. Implementation arrangements\n4.1.1  The project shall be implemented using existing structures namely the MSC (Annex B3 for an institutional assessment of MSC and its organizational structure). The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) will be designated as the Project Executing Agency. The Microfinance Department in the MoFPED will oversee the implementation of the Project. MSC, which was established in 2001 as a company limited by guarantee, is designated as the Project implementation entity and will be responsible for the day to day management of Project activities. MSC is headed by a 7 member Board of Directors. MSC will wholesale loan funds to intermediaries such as SACCOs and MFIs at a competitive interest rates depending on the nature of the relevant loan product. MSC’s strategic plan stipulated different rates of market determined interest for each loan product. These intermediaries will on‑lend credit funds to enterprises in rural areas at a rate of interest that will enable them to recover the cost of capital plus a margin of profit. The processing of loans to intermediaries will be done through the MSC Zonal Offices and governed by the eligibility criteria which are stipulated in the Credit Operations Manual. In addition, MSC will outsource institutional and business development services from viable service providers in the private and public sector.\n4.1.2  The Board of Directors established the Finance, Audit, and Human Resources committees. It also oversees a management structure which comprise of the Executive Director and 6 Heads of Departments, namely Financial Services, Business Development, Marketing and Communication, Company Secretariat and Administration, Internal Audit and Finance and Accounting. In order to decentralize its operations and remain responsive to intermediaries and end target client’s needs, MSC established 12 fully‑staffed Zonal Offices, each with catchments of 5‑7 districts. In total, MSC has a staff complement of 83.\n4.1.3.  The project implementation will be supported by the Uganda Field Office (UGFO). UGFO is also expected to assist in all disbursement and procurement issues.

The\nreviews show that Uganda’s public finance management system is improving and is becoming\nmore reliable given the mitigation measures put in place. It should be noted that existing\nweaknesses/challenges are currently being addressed by the GoU with assistance from\ndevelopment partners in order to further enhance the efficiency of the system, mainly through\ncontrol of public expenditure. In this connec tion, GoU is implementing public administration\nreform with the assistance of donors, including the WB, ADB, DfID and the EU. In addition,\nthe Local Government Development Program supported by the WB and the Institutional\nSupport for Good Governance supported by ADB has enhanced provision of services and\naccountability by local governments. These activ    ities are aimed at mitigating the identified\ngovernance risks.\n4.3.2   As a result, the Bank support to microfinance in Uganda will help ensure transparency\nat all levels and by all intermediary institutions. These will be facilitated by using the standard\nBank procedures and guidelines in addition to the Government’s systemized financial\nmanagement procedure, which has been succ        essfully applied under other on‑going Bank",

"section": "Sustainability",
"content": "4.4.1   The Project has been designed taking into  consideration the financial and operational sustainability of MSC at the end of the Project   life. As outlined in Annex B7, the financial projections indicate that the MSC will be opera tionally sustainable by year 2014. The interest income and fee structure is expected, therefore, to generate additional income to cover operating costs and accelerate the Project’s financ ial self‑sufficiency and sustainability in the 3 years of the Project life. As such, in the firs t two and half years, the company is building a rural financial infrastructure which will start yielding results in the 3 rd year. The company is projected to be operationally self‑sufficient  from YR 3 with an OSS of 103%, 131% in YR 4 and 159% by YR 5 of project implementation.  Th e overall 5‑year OSS is projected to 116%. This is in line with Microfinance best practices.  By YR 5, the company will absorb any past losses and register cumulative net income      before grants of UGX 2.30 billion (UA 0.7 million). Financial self‑sufficiency (FSS) will gradually increase from 20% in 2009 to 78% in 2014. The project will break – even and make a net operating income of UGX 0.23 billion (UA 0.07 million) in the third year, UGX 3.15 billion (UA 0.9 million) in the forth year and UGX 7.07 billion (UA 2.1 million) in the fifth year of the projections. In addition, the training program, technical assistance and support in systems development are expected to enhance the operational capacity and efficiency    of partner organizations, while improving their performance and sustainability.",
